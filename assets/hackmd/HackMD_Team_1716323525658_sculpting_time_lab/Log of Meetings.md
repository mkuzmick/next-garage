Wesley workshop (session 3 of 3)

**attendees**: MDFs - Wesley, Tetsuya; LLUFs - David, Charlie, Ammara, Marcus, Fechi, Aissata

**notes**
* Aissata - How to Get Away with Murder video essay/scene analysis; Aissata still needs to re-record audio but the scene analysis is super compelling and clearly anchored in evidence from the scene.
* Ammara - advises when re-recording to pay attention to space you're recording in because it can change the sound; Ammara is working on a Pride and Prejudice (2004) scene analysis; Ammara is interested in the device of 'a world within a world' - an intimate world constituted by two characters
* Marcus - Kill Your Darlings (2013) scene analysis; interested in how these scenes are about destruction (especially through drug use), modernism, 'creating something new' as a modernist impulse ('destroying the old'); who gets to create something new - this is about class and privilege

Tools discussed:
* VoiceMemo - actually pretty good for recording audio!
