# PROJECT 1 CHECKLIST (AND REVIEW)

## PLANNING

We went over a number of ways to plan the project, but here are three to try out:

1. create a "two column script" that has the audio (especially any spoken text) in one column and the visuals in the other
2. create a visual storyboard for any particularly challenging visual segments (animations, etc)
3. create a Final Cut or Premiere project with "placeholders" or "slugs" that fill out the timeline as you plan and build your work right there in the timeline

## SHOOTING

There are a number of elements we've covered that you might want to consider for Project 1:
* **composition:** are you using a medium shot? a long shot? a medium close-up? *why?* Are you centering your subject in the frame? Are you off center? 
* **lighting:** while you do not need a special 3-point lighting setup for the course, you should make intentional choices. We found that keylights in *front* of the subject (rather than above) were typically more flattering. And that we could achieve more or less drama depending on the amount shadow we added by way of the key-light angle and the key-to-fill-ratio.
* **white-balance:** many of your cameras will perform an "auto-white-balance," but if you are shooting with a pronounced color in the scene, you may want to opt for a manual white-balance on cameras that allow for this.

## AUDIO

* we don't need any fancy audio tricks in these pieces, but you should try your best to get the microphone close to the speaker, and to record in a relatively controlled environment (if possible).
* you can perform some noise reduction in the tools we're teaching you, but it can't perform absolute miracles. Sometimes (in a tool like Adobe Audition) you can get a better result if you've recorded a segment of the "room tone" (just what you hear in the room when no one is talking)--so that's something to remember when shooting (you can also use this room tone to more naturally link together segments instead of dropping to pure silence---or to record in a perfect studio environment at a later date and make everything sound like it was recorded on the same shoot)

## VISUALS

* When we read the Mayer essay, we encountered quite a number of key ideas about visual teaching. For instance, **the signalling principle** involves using visual (and other) elements to highlight the conceptual structure and key elements of what we're discussing. You can do this with your slides/animations. Other principles emphasized the need to use visuals and spoken text rather than too much redundant on-screen text, etc.
* It is *expensive* to create animations, so we are certainly not expecting many of them. But if you have a key figure (a map say, or a chart) that is central to your discussion, it may be worth the effort to create it in Motion or After Effects or Keynote so that you can animate a series of elements that you'll explain in relation to this key figure. (Like Hans Rosling does in the video below)

## EDITING

* If this is intended to be a stand alone piece, include an opening that introduces us to the video. This could just be the presenter saying "welcome to . . . " or you could add a title slide or more elaborate introduction.
* Also consider when we need to see the presenter and when we just need to see the visuals. It is frequently OK to produce a video without the presenter EVER being visible, so we certainly do not need to see them all the time. That said, cutting to the presenter can help punctuate the presentation, accenting certain key thoughts or forcing the viewer to *feel* something at a crucial moment.


## RATIONALE

* In a sense your rationale could just be an explanation of how you have responded to some of the guidelines above (along with other advice you've received from Casey, Marlon or tutorials you've worked through). We mainly want to get a sense of the reasoning behind the choices you've made (and, ideally, that reasoning will be grounded in a thoughtful account of what YOU are trying to achieve in the video). But here are some key ideas to get you started (you do NOT need to cover all of them)
    * Mayer's Principles (have you kept one or more of them in mind while editing? is there a segment that illustrates this?)
    * Shooting considerations (how did you set up your studio? why?)
    * Story considerations (how did you organize and pace your content? why?)
    * Graphics and Animation: did you choose a particular graphical style for any reason? specific fonts? if you created a difficult and complicated animation, tell us something about what went into it!
    * Performance (what choices did you or the performer make? were you deliberately informal? deliberately formal? deliberately slow and thoughtful or deliberately fast-paced?)
    * Editing: did you use mainly short shots or longer ones? did you choose particular transitions or audio effects you'd like us to notice? *why?*
    * Audience: who is the piece for? and what are some of the choices you made based on this?

Again, you do NOT need to answer all of these questions: we are only looking for 1-2 pages here. Just answer the questions that most directly get at the accomplishments you are most proud of or most want us to know about.
