That's me, Marlon, in the studio where I work ([loads more photos here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/boklearninglab)).

And this is the first of what will be a series of docs in which we log what happens in class on a given night. This includes

* links to media we discuss
* links to interesting readings and other references
* notes on key concepts we discuss
* and more!

This is essentially a wiki, and we are all able to contribute if we so choose (it's also OK if you just want the link to the doc for reference).

Elsewhere in HackMD, Casey and I will be responding to questions you send us with links and media and step-by-step tutorials. By doing them here, we'll be able to share them with the whole class (because in many cases other students will have the same questions you do!)

## the plan

1. introductions (the course and all the people)
2. discussion and "jigsaw" activity with [this article about multimedia learning](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LNngk1RapKzpNkuuvc4m_ELjO89lA174/view?usp=sharing)

## introduction to the class

* the syllabus is [here](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/96236/assignments/syllabus), and key points from it that we noted included
    * this is project-based course, and the main focus will be the two big projects you create
    * this is an introductory course, but we will be offering as much individualized support as we can for each student, so we hope that those with experience as video producers will still get something out of the class. That said, you should DM Marlon in Slack to ask specific questions on this front if you are at all concerned

     
## jigsaw activity

* starting at **8:30pm**: in your groups, discuss the segment of the article you've been assigned, first just figuring out what it's saying, then talking a little about how you'd teach this concept to someone else
* then, in the [collaborative Canva]() create a slide or two to help you teach us the concept in 60 seconds or so
* when we come back to the big room at **9:00pm**, we'll give a collective 10-minute lecture on the principles, then we'll spend some time discussing what we've learned

## homework for next time

1. (optional) If you get the time, go ahead and read the whole Mayer article--undoubtedly we'll have trouble talking about all of its elements tonight, so we'll pick up the discussion at the beginning of next week's class.
2. (optional) As you poke around the internet in the course of your everyday life, be on the lookout for models and inspirations that could give the class an idea of what you'd like to make in the course. Post them, along with comments about why you find them to be interesting models, in the Slack channel devoted to `#models-and-inspirations`
3. (required) Finally, we have a [little survey form](https://educationalvi-0e41145.slack.com/archives/C030E4G3BGC/p1643237315765409) we'd love for you to fill out if and when you have time. We're hoping to get a sense of your interests as we plan out the tutorial sessions Casey and I will be offering. (That link takes you to the Slack message in which I posted the link, just to hide it from the open internet!)
