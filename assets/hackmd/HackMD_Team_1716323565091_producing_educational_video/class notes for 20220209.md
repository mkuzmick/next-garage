# class notes for 20220209

Another weekly doc. Casey and I will type in here as we go, but you are ALL welcome to contribute. This is both a record of what we learn on a given night AND the site for us to "co-construct" that learning (if you can handle the jargon!), so please do feel free to jump in!

## the plan

1. pick up where we left off last time with shooting
2. take a look at your home studio set-ups
3. extra sessions this week:
    * 7:30-8:30++ Thursday, Feb 10: Casey on advanced shooting, DSLRs and home studios
    * 7:30-8:30++ Tuesday, Feb 15: Marlon on command lines tools and scription, including ffmpeg and youtube-dl, etc.


## your home studios

Group 4 feedback:
- We really liked the intro where the main points were laid out
- Very high quality camera, lighting, and audio recording
- Added images of the items that were being talked about
- Glare and reflection on glasses (can this be fixed in post?)
- Faint hum in the background 
- Is there a plan for the background? Is it intended to be homey


### Groups 5 & 6

Group 6 feedback:
- Adorable, lovable, and awesome video
- "Warmth" is one of the key feelings recognized by the literature (France, 2020, p. 13)
- Very aesthetic environment
- The light creating an "arch" in the background looks nice (maybe hide the lamp fully?)


## codecs, bitrates, framerates

* a [GREAT resource from frame.io](https://workflow.frame.io/guide#ch=capture) on pretty much everything, but for this topic check out their chapter on "Capture" and the codec section in particular.
* Google's [recommended bitrates for YouTube uploads](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1722171?hl=en#zippy=%2Cframe-rate%2Cbitrate)
* [typical camera specs](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1283257-REG/panasonic_dmc_gh5_mirrorless_micro_four.html/specs)
* [8 bit vs 10 bit video](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/video/tips-and-solutions/8-bit-10-bit-what-does-it-all-mean-for-your-videos)
