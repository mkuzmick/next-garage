# classnotes for 20220223

plan for tonight:

1. last little editing things from last week
    * quick notes on audio
    * don't worry about multicam editing: it's coming!
2. now that I know how to use the editing tool, what do I do with it? (Planning Project 1)
    * unpacking an example
    * planning in the timeline (or elsewhere)
    * quick small group check-ins about Project 1
3. intro to graphics
    * simple options: keynote, powerpoint, canva
    * complex options: Motion and After Effects

## quick audio notes

* fades in and fades out
* what is compression?
* what is noise reduction?

## planning project 1

Now that we know how the editing software works, what do we actually DO with it?? How can we get STARTED on project 1, other that by just thinking about it?

### Breaking down an example:

Let's use our video editing software as a tool for analysis and examination! 
* Grab a model you find inspiring and insert it in your timeline
* start by inserting cuts wherever the video itself has a cut
* for bonus points, add text where it adds text and try to match it
* for even more bonus points, find where it involves graphics, animation and video layering and do your best to imitate it 



### The two column script:
