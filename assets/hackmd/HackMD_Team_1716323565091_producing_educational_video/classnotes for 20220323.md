## OBS Studio

[OBS Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBS_Studio) is an open source (and free!) screencasting and live recording application that enables you to mix many audio and video sources and either stream them live to the web or record them to your computer (or both).

## The Steps We'll Take
(please go ahead and add your own notes!)

1. Install OBS
2. Open OBS
3. On Macs, you'll need to go to System Preferences => Security and Privacy => Screen Recording and add OBS
4. Create a new Scene by clicking the "+" button at the bottom of the Scenes panel (give it a name like "Start" or "Intro" or "Homebase")
5. Add your camera feed by clicking the "+" at the bottom of the Sources panel and selecting "Video Capture Device"
6. Add piece of video you'd like to play in the background by adding a new source and selecting "Media Source." Select a video or gif from your hard drive.
7. Add an image by creating an "Image" source--to make it interesting, you can make it a png with a transparent background. Here's the one I'll use:
![tv screen png](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EOh1AwsUYAExZ_f.png)
9. download a gif that expresses something you think you'd frequently express in your class and add that too
10. Open up a couple of interesting pages on the web or in an application and do a "window share" (you may need to tweak your security preferences to make this work)
11. now resize these windows and play with their positioning and layer order
12. Explore effects
    * add a color correction to your video
    * add a mask to your video (if you need a file to make the mask with, try this gif, or make one yourself in Photoshop or PowerPoint)

10. start up the virtual camera and share in Zoom
11. open up the recording preferences pane, select your desired video format and video destination, then hit record.
12. Now let's start to lay out a series of "scenes" that you'd use to teach your subject matter (or that you'd use to help your teacher-clients teach their subject matter)

## Notes


## Reference

Here's a little tutorial to check out if you are new to the software!

We'll do optional sessions for those who want to do a deep dive---one challenging thing is handling audio, and we won't get to that tonight. But if you just can't wait, here is one of many ways to do it:
