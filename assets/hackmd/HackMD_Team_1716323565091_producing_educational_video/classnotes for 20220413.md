## lookbooks, show bibles, pitch decks, and plans

Tonight we'll be 
1. discussing some of your text-based Project 2 proposals in small groups and the large group (so we're looking for volunteers to share!)
2. then moving on to talk a bit about the "Plan" part of the [Final Project](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/96236/assignments/561289)--and even to get started working on it--which means 
    - looking a bit at pitch decks, show bibles, and lookbooks
    - looking at how we might try to create a pitch deck or lookbook in Canva (and hopefully squeezing in a bit of practice)
    - for those of you interested in doing the VISUAL component of the "Plan" as a "Lookbook" for [Quicktask 7](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/96236/assignments/561287), we'll run through the requirements for that too
    - again in small groups, going in search of at least ONE image that represents a key element of your planned series (see below for ideas)


## The Plan

In the world of TV production, there are many many documents that outline what makes the show the show: [pitch decks](https://aarondavis.com/the-tracks-tv-series-pitch-deck/), [look books](https://www.premiumbeat.com/blog/create-professional-film-lookbook/), ["bibles"](https://www.scriptreaderpro.com/tv-show-bible-examples/) ...the words thrown around can get confusing and, to make matters worse, sometimes people use some of them interchangeably! But even if you try to maintain strict separation between these (see [here](https://screencraft.org/2020/09/01/how-to-write-tv-bibles-pro-tips/#:~:text=Treatment%3A%20A%20treatment%20is%20a,story%20of%20the%20pilot%20script.&text=Pitch%E2%80%93Deck%3A%20While%20often%20interchangeable,into%20a%20single%20long%20document.) for a solid attempt to differentiate them all), it's frequently the case that the ideas and assets you generate for one of these docs can help you out in the others. And when you see [a great one](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59300eae86e6c0d14e6949c8/t/5ddf9b3035fa141ad055c80b/1574935353991/StrangerThings_Bible.pdf), it's remarkable just how perfectly it can capture the tone of the project and lay out a strong foundation for the production to come.

So whatever you want to call it--a look book, a bible, a pitch deck, a production plan--we are going to make one for the series we're going to make. You can choose a visual form that's appropriate for your industry or your own goals (they can be [playful](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59300eae86e6c0d14e6949c8/t/5ddf9bf16e39282dec3270d6/1574935549608/AdventureTimeSeriesBible.pdf) or [serious](https://www.pandadoc.com/graphic-design-proposal-template/)), but content-wise each plan should include at least a short, paragraph-length or single-slide section for each of the following:

* A short summary of what the course/series is about
* Short bio(s) for the star(s) (in this case, the teachers)
* the titles of 5-10 initial topics for short, segmented videos (remember Mayer's segmenting principle!)
* Briefly annotated reference images that give us a sense of the visual style of the show (what will the video content look like? what will the graphical elements look like?)
* If appropriate, a brief description of the locations and equipment you will deploy
* A bullet-form sketch of the timeline for making the series and a break-down of the process for one of the videos
* A "distribution plan" (where will the videos go? how will they appear there?)
* A short stakeholder-facing rationale for your plan (if you are writing for senior Deans at your institution, for instance, you may want to explain the educational and financial implications of some of your decisions). Feel free to quote Mayer here!


## Quicktask 7: The Lookbook

If QuickTask 7 invites you to pitch the visual look of your final project. In a presentation tool of your choice (but in one capable of producing a publishable web-based export) create a "look-book" for your series, annotation each image with a sentence or two that explains its relevance to your project (and a footnote saying where it came from, if you found it rather than making it). Here are the details:

* you can do this in any tool capable of producing an online presentation or visual story, but especially good tools for this would be Canva.com and Adobe Spark, which can create those "Glide Shows" we've been practicing.
* include at least 1 or more images showing us how you intend to compose the main shot of the presenter/teacher
* include at least 1 or more annotated images that give us a sense of the teacher's character and mode of screen-presence (professorial? more Sesame Street? more YouTube personality?)
* include at least 1 or more images showing us the sort of location you have in mind and how you intend to dress the set (Links to an external site.)
* if appropriate, include at least 1 or more images that give us a sense of the fonts you'll use
* if appropriate, include at least 1 or more images that give us a sense of the sorts of insert shots and b-roll you'll use
* if appropriate, include at least 1 or more images that give us a sense of the style and purpose of the graphical elements you'll use
* for any other key camera angles (i.e. close-ups, overheads, etc) include a reference shot
* Add all of this up and you'll get to a "Glide Show" of 7-10 images (or more!) that will involve at least 7-10 sentences of text to go along with those images. This will be a GREAT QuickTask to perform on the way to Project 2, because much of what you create here will be reusable there!

For those wanting to perform this QuickTask, it would be great if you could turn it in here and to the Slack by class-time on April 20th (we'll discuss them in class that day).
