learning Final Cut! As always, there are GREAT places to go if you want a deeper dive. The [LinkedIn Learning Essentials Course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/final-cut-pro-x-10-6-essential-training/all-roads-lead-to-final-cut-pro-x?autoAdvance=true&autoSkip=false&autoplay=true&resume=true&u=2194065) is obviously fantastic. And there are some useful YouTube tutorials on specific "moves" you can make in Final Cut too. If you are EVER finding yourself wanting to do some specific thing or other, definitely try searching YouTube for it, because there is bound to be a tutorial on it (or just ask Marlon and Casey!) If you love reading the manual, then Apple's [Final Cut Pro User Guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/final-cut-pro/welcome/mac) may be useful to you!

## the steps we'll take

1. create a new Library (and learn [what a Library is](https://support.apple.com/guide/final-cut-pro/what-are-libraries-verfdd5c590e/mac))
2. [create a new Event](https://support.apple.com/guide/final-cut-pro/create-a-new-event-verf3fd270b/mac) called "Projects"(and rename the default event "Footage")
3. [import some footage](https://support.apple.com/guide/final-cut-pro/intro-to-importing-media-verd0e77425/mac) into the "Footage event" and learn to add keywords to it
4. create a new Project in the "Projects" event (and learn about settings)
5. bring footage into the timeline (in many ways!) and start editing!
    * if you are new to Final Cut, please go ahead and play around at this stage--if this is ALL you learn tonight, that is totally fine! You already know enough to get the project done once you get to step 5!
6. "connect" a connected clip (and learn about them)
7. adding some audio
8. "transform" using the Transform tool
9. changing parameters in the Inspector
10. color correction
11. effects (especially masks)
12. titles and generators
13. exporting
14. sneak preview of Motion (i.e. why we'd use it)

## things we'll try to remember

* j, k, and l to play footage forwards and backwards (and to stop it)
* command+c to copy
* command+shift+v to paste properties
* E = add to the "End" of the timeline
* W = "Wedge" it in
* Q = "Qonnect it" as a connected clip
