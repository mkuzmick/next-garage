# resolve notes 20220217

Resolve is a fantastic option as an editor, a color corrector, and even a bit of motion graphics. as a good starting point, besides our class session, [LinkedinLearning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/davinci-resolve-fundamentals?trk=learning-topics_learning-search-card_search-card&upsellOrderOrigin=default_guest_learning) has a really great fundamentals course available. for something that slightly less intensive, [Casey Faris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozj-aQH0kiE) has an interesting crash course video available, and he also has a good series of more targeted overviews for specific tools and techniques. 

the steps weâ€™ll take

* create a project 
* get a feel for the workspace
* import some footage
* create a timeline
* bring footage into the timeline (in many ways!)
* adding audio
* changing parameters in the Effects Control panel
* [color correction](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/color-for-video-editors?trk=learning-topics_trending-courses_related-content-card&upsellOrderOrigin=default_guest_learning)
