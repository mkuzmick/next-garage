# 20240319 mdf meeting

## updates
* Lara CL grad mixer on April 2 from 6 - 8! BRING YOUR FRIENDS!
* we'll have pizza! so we need a headcount

## activity: design a way to celebrate YOUR work!
* today is the launch of getting ready for the end of the term
* we're going to think about
    * ways you might celebrate and show your work
    * all the tools you might choose
    * thinking divergently
    * things you’d want to print
    * things you’d want to make and show
    * written things
    * gifts/buttons/swag you'd want to design and make
    * supplies you need the LL to order
* we’ll invite faculty from your dept that are relevant to mdf program and probably none of them will come but we’ll plan like they are!
* and next year’s mdfs will be there
* other people from bok center
* TL;DR: if there’s anything you wish you had done, this is the time to do it - not something totally new but like if you want to use the green screen or make a button or make a montage of workshops you ran!
* paper prototype your MDF work celebration display/exhibit
    * note all the things you'll need
    * where would they go
    * think about what technical needs you'd have
    * how would you want to activate this space
* next time: we'll think about the storytelling side of this - for now think BIG! and get down all of your possible ideas for celebrating your MDF work
