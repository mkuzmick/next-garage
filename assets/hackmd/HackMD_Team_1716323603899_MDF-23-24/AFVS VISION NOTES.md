Prompts (in this order) for the Vision AI:

**Note: The basic principle that underlies these questions is to ask the AI to link a formal device to a conceptual/thematic/historical "message". 

The main question to reiterate in different forms is: *how does "a formal theme in the work become an overarching concept of the work"?*

For example: *How does the color purple in the image become a theme that points to queerness? What about the way purple is being used suggests queerness?*

1. What are the formal qualities of this image?
2. Descrbe how X (a formal quality) is working in this image.
3. Describe how X relates to a conceptual (or historical, or emotional) theme present in the image.
4. What is the tone/mood/atmosphere of this image? 
5. How do the formal qualities accomplish creating this tone/mood/atmosphere?
6. What is the overarching theme of this image? 
7. What are additonal sub-themes of this image?
8. Is there a dominant formal decive used in this image, what is it?
9. How would the image be altered if X were not present?
10. Is the action of the image clear or ambiguous?
11. What qualities of the image create that clarity or ambiguity?
12. Write a gallery wall label for this image that incoporates historical and well as material and conceptual notes about this image.
13. Describe the a version of this image where the formal elements are taken to an extreme use. 
14. Describe the opposite of this image.
