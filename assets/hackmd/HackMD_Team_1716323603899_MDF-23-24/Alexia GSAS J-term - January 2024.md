## Exploring the Cosmos: An Introduction to Our Solar System and 3D Modeling  

*Total Hours: 11 hours* 

*Contact:* Alexia Simon, 5th year PhD student in the Astronomy Department
*E-mail:* alexia.simon@cfa.harvard.edu

### Course Description

Have you ever wanted to combine your interest in science with creative art projects? This hands-on and interactive class will introduce students to basic astronomy concepts while teaching them how to create 3D models of astronomical objects using the open-source software Blender.

Students will learn about the key features of planets in our solar system, such as compositions, sizes, orbits, moons, etc. through interactive group exploration of a realistic 3D model of the Solar System. They will explore what makes each planet unique from a physical, chemical, and geological perspective by examining materials like rock samples, image analysis, and videos.

The second half of each class will focus on using Blender to turn their new astronomy knowledge into creative 3D projects. Students will learn the Blender interface and modeling tools to construct any astronomical object of their choice and add details like textures to represent different planetary surfaces and conditions.

By the end of the course, students will present their astronomical models in an interactive green screen presentation. The class aims to spark interest in both science and design through a blend of learning, hands-on project work and science communication.

### Student Learning Outcomes
At the completion of the course, students will be able to:

- Describe the overall structure and composition of our solar system
- Identify the major objects within our solar system
- Become familiar with using a telescope
- Learn to utilize a 3D modeling software (Blender) to design 3D objects and environments
- Apply modeling techniques and create animation on their 3D objects
- Develop their communication and presentation skills
- **Have fun creating art that showcases scientific concepts!**

### Weekly Schedule
#### Session 1 (2.5 hours)

- **Introduction to our Solar System (1h30)**
-- Scale of our Solar System
-- Overview of the different objects in the Solar System: Sun, planets, comets and asteroids 
-- Deeper understanding of our Sun: composition, size, temperature, role in solar system
-- Comparative planetology by looking at the similarities and differences between planets and the Sun
- **Introduction to the 3D modeling project (15 min)**
Students choose one astronomical object (planet, comet or asteroid) that they will model in 3D software. They will choose to represent one aspect of the object: chemical, physical, texture or history in their ~5-10 min presentation by using the green screen and diverse cameras present at the Learning Lab 
- **Learning the basics of 3D modeling software at the Bok center Learning Lab computers (45 min)**
-- Introduction to Blender
-- Basics keyboard shortcuts
-- Interface overview, importing/exporting files and basic shapes, meshes, materials
-- Extruding and subdividing shapes to model the basic featureslike mountains, valleys, impact craters of a planet 


#### Session 2 (2 hours)
- **Learning of the Outer Solar System objects (45 min)** 
-- Jupiter: great red spot, bands, composition, largest moons
-- Saturn: rings, composition, seasons on Titan
-- Uranus: axial tilt, extreme seasons, moons
-- Neptune: winds, density, Triton
- **Activity (1h15 min)**: Students will model a gas giant planet with rings and texture its clouds/atmosphere. They will add one moon and apply textures to represent its surface features

#### Optional Telescope Lab (1 hour)
We will go to the Harvard University Astronomy Lab and Clay Telescope available at the science center 8th Floor to observe the Moon and at least one planet. The planet aimed to be observe in January 2024 would be Saturn, which is great to observe its ring. 

#### Session 3 (2 hours)
- **Learning of the Inner Solar System objects (45 min)** 
-- Mercury: proximity to Sun, lack of atmosphere, day/night cycle
-- Venus: runaway greenhouse effect, dense atmosphere, surface conditions
-- Earth: composition, seasons, magnetic field, moons
-- Mars: red color, polar ice caps, potential for past life
- **Activity (1h15 min)**: Students will chose their astronomical object they want to modelize. They will start with a 30 min hand-on design of their project with filming camera and paper material. Then they'll start on Blender. 

#### Optional 3D Office Hour (1 hour)
The Bok Center Learing Lab will be open for an hour in order to help and supervise the students projects.  

#### Session 4 (2.5 hours)
- **Learning of the other Astronomical objects (30 min)** 
-- Asteroids: composition, size range, asteroid belt
-- Comets: composition, tails, orbits
- **Activity (max 2h)**: Students will present their thinking process and final model by using a green screen showing their model with which they can interact. The presentation is aimed between 5-10 minutes. 

## Projects examples

Example of planet modeling projects:
-- Mercury with its cratered terrain
-- The cloud bands of Jupiter,
-- Saturn surrounded by its rings. 
Optional: adding moons, stars or basic animations to their scenes/environment.
