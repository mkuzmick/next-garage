## messy notes 


* What do you know already from your departments, if anything? What have you already been asked to do?
    * alexia has flagged that there has been faculty turnover in astronomy 
        * new department heads 
        * help requested on ASTRO17 (double-check all these courses)
            * potential help with ASTRO1
        * GENED1070 another large course, split into four (including chemistry? seems like a STEM sampler)
            * they do a report and a presentation 
            * Alexia flagged that TFs may need support on how to grade these varied projects in this huge class 

    * Allyson Bieryla, the chair of undergrad observations, person in charge of the observatories is excited 
        * has asked for Alexia's help with all sort of courses 

        * we can help come up with new assignments, course designs, etc to present to faculty 


    * cd asks: how about grad-facing programing? 
        * alexia: 
            * helping grad students prepare for the job market: 
                * websites 
                * presentations 
                * 3D modeling
                    * but only for those focusing on instrumentation 
                    * cd says a "tool time" could be excellent 
                        * one-hour asset creation 
                        * with a pedagogical element as well
                * everything related to AI 
                    * a workshop from Stubbs 
                        * writing proposals, letters of recommendations
                            * what are the limitations? how can we use it ethically to help our work? 
                            * how to use it? 
                    * physics department 
                        * teaching a course on ai 
                            * a lot of interest from astronomers 
                            * a focus on what is legal, less focus on how to use it 
                            
    
* what do you want to learn/how do you want to grow this year?
    * 3D modeling 
    * AI 
        * leveraging use for professional skills 
        * scaffolding activities for students 
            * when to use it, when to not? 
    * graphic design 
    * video essays/presentations 
        * beyond slides, to graphics and animations 

    * cd loves that Alexia wants to learn all of these and help with grad-facing program, but eants to make sure we tie all these goals to specific courses
        * asks alexia for more guidance on courses/specificity of which courses we can reach out about. 


### marlon thoughts/questions 

* he brings up another area for application of LL 
    * student obersvations 
        * where do student observations go? how are they recorded? 
            * how do students work with these observations later? why do they do them? 
        * Alexia bring sup this is a good point, saying poeople are often cold and in the dark trying to make obervational notes. 
            * often is work doen at home if at all
