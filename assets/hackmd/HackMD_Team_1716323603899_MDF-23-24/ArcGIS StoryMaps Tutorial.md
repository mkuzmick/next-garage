# ArcGIS StoryMaps Tutorial


Students are tasked with creating a StoryMap about a performance of a gospel song. 

Below is a step-by-step guide of how to use ArcGIS Online. 

## Step By Step Map Creation
### **1. Sign Up or Log In**
- **Access ArcGIS Online:** Go to https://harvard-cga.maps.arcgis.com/ and log in with your university credentials. When you click sign in in the upper right hand corner, click on the blue box that says Harvard, and it will prompt you to enter your HarvardKey. 

### **2. Create Your StoryMap**
- **Navigate to StoryMaps:** Once logged in, find the "StoryMaps" button in the tile menu in the upper right hand corner and click on it.
- **Start a New StoryMap:** Click on the "Create New StoryMap" button.
- **Select the Side Car Option:** For your layout, choose the "Side Car" option, which allows for a dynamic storytelling format.

### **3. Importing and Adding Content**
- **Add Content:** Look for the "little green plus" icon to add new content blocks to your StoryMap.
- **Import Data:** When adding maps or data, click on "Import" and select the files or datasets you wish to include. This data can include a variety of things-- audio, video, maps, tables, text, and more. 

### **4. Adding Text and Narratives**
- **Text Blocks:** To add text, click on the "Text" option from the content block menu, then type your narratives or descriptions.
- **Formatting:** Utilize the text formatting tools to enhance readability and engagement.

### **5. Creating an Express Map**
- **Access Express Map:** Within your StoryMap, click the "little green plus" and select the "Map" option to start an Express Map.
- **Add Points of Interest:** Use the search function or click directly on the map to add locations. Ensure you provide descriptive text for each point.

### 6. Putting Your Map in Shared Update
* **Navigate to the update group:** Find the update group that your professor has created. You can do this by searching for the group name or accessing it through the "groups" tab in the upper bar menu.
* **Add your StoryMap:** Once in the group, select the option to "Add item" or "Share item." Choose the StoryMap you wish to share from your content.
* **Confirm the addition:** After selecting your StoryMap, confirm the addition to the group. This will make your StoryMap accessible to both your professor and fellow students within the shared update group.
### **7. Collaboration and Publishing**
- **Single Editor Limitation:** Remember, ArcGIS does not support simultaneous editing. Coordinate with teammates to avoid conflicts.
- **Publish Your StoryMap:** Once your story is complete, click on the "Publish" button. You'll have options for sharing publicly or with specific groups.

### **Final Touches**
- **Review and Edit:** Use the preview feature to see how your StoryMap will look to viewers, making any necessary adjustments before publishing.
- **Engagement:** Keep your audience engaged with interactive elements and a compelling narrative throughout your StoryMap.
