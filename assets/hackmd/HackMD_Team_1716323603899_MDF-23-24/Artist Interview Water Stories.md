# Artist Interview Water Stories 
## HAA 81 Art of Monsoon Asia 

Aims: >> Connect the interview not just to HAA81 this fall, but use it as a great template for me to present to at the faculty meeting in late Nov. to the other faculty who work with contemporary artists can integrate interviews into their courses. Instead of it being a one off interview, I will work with the video footage to grab clips/sound bites that to integrate into course lecture presentations. It would be an innovate interview format that I think could be useful for other courses geared toward contemporary art and art making practices (makes this interview relevant to course work for HAA at large). <<

Realistically one interview either both of them in the same conversation or just one artist).  Jinah will interview them in the Learning Lab space where there are numerous high quality cameras to capture different angles. There will be materials (string/twine, photographs of water, student photo contributions) available to integrate into the interview. This allows Jinah to talk with the artist(s) about their process and allows us to see how the artist(s) think with their hands. Using the multi cams we can capture them playing with and manipulating materials in real time. I can envision edited clips of these art making shots being incorporated into a lecture as a side by side with a finished artwork used in the course. 
* Having Jinah interview the artist as opposed to students will give a template for future students to see how you conduct an interviewâ€”what kind of questions you prep, how to guide conversations and be prepared enough to improvise on your feet through the conversation  
*  #### follow up with JK: organizing the interview. two 30-45 min discussions (one with each artist)? 

### Student involvement:  
Have the students go to the exhibition and take 20 photos each on their phones. In your interview, you could present these images and the students perspectives or take aways from the artworks and its connection to our course. If we have any students interested in video editing (like Julia) they might be interested in coming to see the raw interview and then how it becomes edited into polished clips and a more presentable whole.

My role: 
Pre-interview prep of the space and gathering materials. Coordination of LL Bok center space. Research into interviews and what makes an engaging interview. Talking with Jinah and the artists about what you want to bring. 
Post-interview: I will work on the editing and transcript side.
