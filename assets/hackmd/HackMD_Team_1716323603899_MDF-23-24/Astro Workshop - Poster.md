#### Workshop will be held begining of December 2023 - Between 4th to 14th of December 

- Introduction: 
1) Personal + Bok presentation 
2) Asking people to give their experience on AAS - What kind of conference is it? 
- Transposing from Article to Poster: Academic format are meant to be read in a linear way, while poster have space/sections where your ideas can be connected to each others. 
- From PSY1018: "We talked about how we present posters in the same way we might give someone a tour of our home. We don’t need to memorize everything we are going to say. We are familiar with everything we want to talk about and can guide our audience through our work without a script." 


### Activity 1  ~25min

The thing we could do together would be looking at examples of different poster and sort them by how attractive/eye catching they are. A few things to look at when analyzing the posters are:

- **Fonts**: The use of bold, colors etc.. to organize the ideas. 
- **Space**: How the differnts 'blocks' are set-up in space. The aligment and proximity of objects. How is it impacting the structure of the content? 
- **Texts**: Thinking about how important the text is vs.the use of images/icons/figures ? 

**Hand on activity** associated to that part: 

- Using cards for students to cut and shape in their way to transcript their research. No text is expected for this activity except maybe titles. The goals is for student to determine there own most important sections for their poster. 
- Materials: I am expecting to have this session on the tables. We'll need a TV to project the examples. Various colored cards and scissors are needed.

### Activity 2 ~25min

Designing a poster layout from a 'famous' astronomy paper : https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...529L..45C/abstract. 
This paper discuss about the discovery of a gas giant type of planet from radial velocity measurements of the star HD 209458.

**Hand on activity** associated to that part:

- For this activity students will need to shape the poster associated to this paper. We will need to print multiples examples of the paper that students will cut and move arround on a bigger paper representing the poster. I am excpecting student to do drawings/icons and set apropriate titles and maybe keyworks. 
- I am aiming to use the main table with the top camera.

### Activity 3 ~25min

For this activity, the goal is to project their poster created on activity 1 or 2 -- or their own poster they made so far -- and stand next to it by using the green screen. The goal of this activity would be to themself highlight their main points and expose their reasons. That would be a time for reflection and feedbacks. 

**Hand on activity** associated to that part:

- Standing up next to their 'virtual' poster and presenting it ! 


### Potential Activity 4 

For this activity students can create a template? 

### Potential Activity 5

Talk about iPoster.
