# Bes Bajraktarević: Bok Media & Design Fellow

Media & Design Fellows support innovative course development, partnering with faculty and Learning Lab staff to design a variety of digital tools, course materials and content, and assignments for undergraduate courses and their departments. MDFs design interactive, technically complex learning experiences for students that introduce them to the affordances of different media, and they develop workshops and other forms of guidance that help students succeed in using new media to convey their ideas and demonstrate subject-matter expertise. 

## Learning Lab Training

### Pedagogical Training

Throughout the year, MDFs develop their multimodal pedagogy, learning during orientation and at biweekly MDF meetings:
* how to design activities, prototype assignments, and create resources that help students in the particular courses they are supporting. 
* how to develop their own style of multimodal pedagogy as they think through the specific media that align with their discipline’s methods and means of analyzing data. 
* the affordances of different media and what students gain, intellectually and analytically, by engaging with those media forms

            prompt used: "a diagram of books and medical symbols"

Bes brought students from GENED 1078 to the Learning Lab as they prepared their final creative projects to learn about different media forms and what they enable one to communicate. Bes had students unpack multimodal forms (a video essay and a podcast) and asked students to think about how their constituent parts work together to tell a compelling story. Bes really wanted students to grasp that every media form has its specific ways of communicating knowledge and insight, representing and conveying experience, and reaching an imagined audience. Students were encouraged to choose their medium intentionally for this final creative project, depending on their goals and the specific story they wanted to tell. Bes then gave students readings from the course and asked them to remediate that course reading in different forms, using audio, graphic design and illustration, and video. Students then had to think about the strengths and limitations of each of these media for communicating the key insights of that reading. This exercise intended to introduce students to the kind of critical insight about media forms that they could carry into their plans for and development of the final creative project.
