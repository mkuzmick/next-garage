# Celtic Graduate Workshop #1 : Digital Resources in Celtic Studies
## Introduction
Dia daoibh, a chairde, agus go raibh míle maith agaibh as a bheith anseo. 

As you know, I'm the Bok Center Media and Design fellow for the department. It's a little odd being the MDF for Celtic, because our department is so small and the work of the Learning Lab at 50 Church St. is often geared toward undergrads. 

So, in trying to decide on a project for my fellowship, the department thought that this workshop series would be useful for everyone.

Today, we'll be spending the next hour:
1. discussing what digital resources are available to us in Celtic Studies at a 10,000 foot level
2. looking more closely at a few of these projects and 
3. discussing two or three technologies which you can use to enhance your engagement with them.  

## Available lists of resources
- [CSANA](https://celtic-studies.org/resources/)
- [Celtic Graduate Students' Sharepoint](https://hu.sharepoint.com/sites/CelticStudents/SitePages/Online-Resources.aspx?source=https%3a//hu.sharepoint.com/sites/CelticStudents/SitePages/Forms/ByAuthor.aspx)
    - Many of the links in these lists are outdated. In my capacity as webmaster of CSANA and MDF of our department, I am in the process of updating them and adding to them with digital resources that I think are useful and relevant to our field of study.
- Other???
    - As with many things in the digital space, a great emphasis is placed on collective action and development. If you find a digital resource that you think is relevant to the work of our field or of an adjacent field, share it.
    - It's important to stress that there is **no** central repository for these resources. There is no guarantee that anyone else will find them for you.

### Updating the resources list:
- Some thoughts on organization/expansion:
    - How useful is organizing by language community at the highest level or should this be reserved for language learning materials?
    - What subfields are worth "spiking out" for emphasis?
        - Linguistics?
        - Archaeology?
        - Numismatics?
    - What fields of study are close enough to ours that they are worth storing, monitoring, and sharing within our scholarly community?
        - For me this might be:
            - Languages like Anglo-Norman, Old and Middle English, Old Norse
            - Relevant History in neighboring countries: 
                - Ecclesiastical
                - Political
                - Military
    - Many of the digital resources we all use regularly are easy to remember, but some might be relevant and a quick link would be useful to others. 
        - some examples:
            - [Historic Environment Map](https://maps.archaeology.ie/HistoricEnvironment/)
            - [Norse World](https://maps.archaeology.ie/HistoricEnvironment/)
            - [Monastic Matrix](https://arts.st-andrews.ac.uk/monasticmatrix/search)

These are just some introductory comments that are worth thinking about in the coming weeks and months. Please keep me in mind.

With that out of the way, let's look at what's out there for us.
