                *  tour of the studio 
                *  ideas of what grad students might do in their own research 
            * marlon asks if they make anything 
                * chris says they do in the spriong, but the fall's focus is on their development of their careers and research specifically 
            * marlon asks about ai and chatGPT
                * Chris says yes, in October/November 
                * has not finalized readings and activites, as the space is evolving so quickly

* workshops helping with: 
    * GENED1042 
        * podcasting 
            * online, over zoom 
            * october 5th, 1:30-2:45pm 

* grad-facing events 
    * more HH-like support asked for from GSAS
        * chris flags he'd love to help with HH, espeically at the beginning stages of deciding visuals 
            * he's talked with Jordan already 
        * cd asks that he give a small presentation on his HH experience for MDF orientation 
    * group events of individual support 



* what do you want to learn/how do you want to grow this year?
    * chris still wants to focus on relaity lab and the blending points between labs 
        * specifcally UNREAL used within the studio in a live sense 
            * also UNREAL for avLab 
        * using python in blender 
            * asking chatGPT to create code 
            * chatGPT plugin for blender 
    * cd asked about professional goals: 
        * chris would love to be able to present himself as someone who can visual data within blender 
            * chris also wonders why blender is preferred for some data visualization, when 2D would work as well. 
            * marlon says, as Chris works on installations, that working on a disseration riff within an HH-style format, but rendered in 3D space, surrounded by assets, would be amazing. 
    * chris is wondering how to better incorporate 3D into student courses
        * ai is likely the answer, to lower the bar of skill entry into using these tools and spaces 
            * marlon flagged that Casey runs workshops for the pyramid schemes course that has a 3D gallery as a final project. 

* dream courses 
    * chris flags that he loves working with film-based courses, such as AFVS70 (this year is Hayden Guest)


## interesting sidenotes 
* similar to Siriana, Chris is thinking about the next frontier of academic communication 
    * chris is interested in creating live, 3D spaces rendered through multilple cameras, which we can interact with. 
        * blender the real and the UNreal to create immersive, novel experiences
