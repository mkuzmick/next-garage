# Emily Rivard 20230906

## [application](https://airtable.com/appER3UOwZSXxxqEA/tblxzbWopU0fJvUaD/viwLPNBOz8mqYyFPh/rec5QRmEzjfLtu99l?blocks=hide)

excerpts from application: 

"I argue that finding more ways to incorporate drawing into modern biology courses can help increase studentsâ€™ awareness and also help them better remember what they are observing...It would be useful to develop new activities for students to process and interpret visual information by drawing or tracing, such as working with a camera lucida (there is now an app for it!) or asking students to trace images on tablets using Illustrator...Practicing scientific illustration is not only useful for students as they learn course content, but also a helpful exercise as students prepare to create visuals for presentations, graphical abstracts, and posters."


"I would be eager for the chance to serve as a Bok-based MDF for the upcoming year.  I would like to apply the expertise I have been building in teaching skills (e.g., designing and leading workshops) and technical skills (e.g., Illustrator) towards developing assignments and supporting more courses that are engaging students with different forms of media and communication. I would also like to learn about and improve my skills with other software. For example, I would like to expand upon the simple animation skills I worked on this year in Keynote by learning about After Effects. I also would like to spend time working with Photoshop to see how I might use it in conjunction with Illustrator to create useful visuals for presentations or videos."


"I have wondered if any STEM, music, or visual arts courses might be interested in establishing collaborative, interdisciplinary assignments that allow students in different disciplines to contribute the expertise they are developing in their respective courses toward a resource like one of these videos. The chance for a student learning biology to collaborate with a student learning music could not only lead to the creation of a useful resource for the students but also give them experience communicating with non-expert audiences as they will need to explain their work to each other."

## areas of interest
* infographics/poster making
* drawing 


## messy notes

* what do you know already from your departments, if anything? What have you already been asked to do?
    * courses: 
        * SCRB111
            * videos
        * PSY1816
            * infographics and sci comm
        * PSY1018
            * infographics and graphic design
        * PSY980T
            * poster making
        * NEURO101
                * poster making
  
    * grad-facing support or events? 
        * graduate student Friday seminars
            * emily wants to incorporate coaching for those seminars 
        * two different retreats for MCB
            * one for grad students, one for all 
                * the grad student one: 
                    * Emily wants to help with the retreat program
                        * workshops/coaching on presentations (speech and graphics)
                        * this occurs in August 
                            * so would be planning for next August
        * helping Alexa with the journal club 
        * graphic abstract night?
            * another potential collab with Alexa 




* what do you want to learn/how do you want to grow this year?
    * Emily is really excited this year, now that she has a better grasp on graphic tools, really honing in on design strategies: 
        * happy to be on graphicsLab
        * wants to be more thoughtful on design 
            * beyond aesthetics and into theory 
    * specific tools 
        * software, keynote, animations (aftereffects)
            * cd flags collaborations between different labs (avLab specifically)
                * but also wants Emily to think of the pedagogical applications of animation 
                    * Emily says that animations are great for visualizing spacially-complex objects in class 
                        * also good for visuals in presentations 
            * Emily also wants to continue to improve her work in the adobe suite, specifically Illustrator
    * cd flags that tooltimes are another great way to gain these new skills. 
        * plan to create a tooltime on aftereffects 


## interesting side notes: 

* how to request work/tooltimes/collaboration across labs
    * is there a process? or just slack? 
    * goal for showcase as well at end of term/in spring:
            * showcasing work from/across multiple different labs
