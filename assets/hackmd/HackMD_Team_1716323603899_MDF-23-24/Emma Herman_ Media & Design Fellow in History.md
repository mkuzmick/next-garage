Media & Design Fellows support innovative course development, partnering with faculty and Learning Lab staff to design a variety of digital tools, course materials and content, and assignments for undergraduate courses and their departments. MDFs design interactive, technically complex learning experiences for students that introduce them to the affordances of different media, and they develop workshops and other forms of guidance that help students succeed in using new media to convey their ideas and demonstrate subject-matter expertise.

Throughout the year, MDFs develop their multimodal pedagogy, learning during orientation and at biweekly MDF meetings:
* how to design activities, prototype assignments, and create resources that help students in the particular courses they are supporting. 
* how to develop their own style of multimodal pedagogy as they think through the specific media that align with their disciplineâ€™s methods and means of analyzing data. 
* the affordances of different media and what students gain, intellectually and analytically, by engaging with those media forms

In History 1056, students create scientific posters about their research in the course. To help students think about the significance of layout and graphic design to argument structures and conveying complex information, Emma brought students to the Learning Lab for a poster design workshop. Emma's goal was to help students learn what it means to translate information from the sort of textual medium with which students are very familiar to something more visual, concise, and accessible. Emma helped students develop paper prototypes of the posters they eventually digitally designed and presented.

### Digital Resource Guide

Emma has been developing an easy to navigate collection space for the nuts and bolts of writing history. Emma has been collating resources related to managing sources, articles, notes, and essays, hoping to help students find the digital tools and workflows that will help them with the research and writing process.
