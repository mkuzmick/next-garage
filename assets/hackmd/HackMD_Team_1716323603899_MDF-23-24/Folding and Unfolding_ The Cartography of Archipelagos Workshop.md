# Folding and Unfolding: The Cartography of Archipelagos Workshop

## learning goals
* deepening understanding of course texts through multimodal exercises
* layer media to produce new meanings, understandings, and relations between forms, between readings, between modes of thinking
* expose the materiality of words
* helping students prepare for final multimodal projects 

## plan
* 6 groups of 4 (one group of 5)
    * choose a button to join their group
* 2 zones
    * paper + arts supplies
    * a/v
* choose a particular archipelagic feature at each station 
    * water
    * air
    * land
* make a "piece" of your archipelago in each media form
    * each student/group of students will visit each station
* a few quick tips about editing in the film and sound zone
* write down at least 1 rationale per station that explains why you're using that form to create that part of the archipelago
    * ex.: why are you making "air" in arts supplies
* share out
