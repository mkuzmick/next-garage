# G4 Symposium Workshop Planning


## Post-workshop reflection

Things that went well
* the story boarding card activity (students had order and explain their partners story board) 
* throughout all the activities lots of positive discussion about what moves worked what not so much
* the other

Things that could be improved
* Improved rational and introduction at beginning of workshop
* Having better segues between the three activities 
* Next time would spend less time breaking down the examples at the start and more time on the activity at the end as I felt like that was more productive and engaging for everyone. So would perhpas have a couple different rounds of that, or maybe have a scaffolding activity lead into it.

**Introduction /Justificaiton:**


**What is the purpose of the G4 symposium?**
This is a unique opportunity for you to share your work with the department in a supportive and encouraging environment. In addition to being a requirement for graduation, it is a chance to catch up with your cohort and make new connections with faculty and students in the department.  
  
**What should the scope of my talk be?**
You can choose to talk in-depth about one project you’re working on, or you can talk briefly about multiple projects—it’s up to you!  
  
**How long should my talk be?**
Each student will have 25 minutes TOTAL. This includes:  
5 minute faculty introduction  
15 minutes for your talk  
5 minutes for questions and transition  
***please rehearse talk timing!  
  
**Who will my audience be?** 
All OEB graduate students and faculty are encouraged to attend the entire symposium.

**What are we doing today in this workshop?**

While many of us may not exactly be sure what we are going to present at this point in time, we are at least all familiar with the systems we work in and projects we are working on. The purpose of this workshop is to start thinking about how we can structure the narrative of a presentation to lead the audience through your research. 

We are going to focus on three key moves in sci-comm / presentations and how you might be able to apply this to your own presentation.
* What is the narrative of your presentation?
* Who is your “main character”
* Using a visual “home base” to guide your audience through the moves you are making.

What is narrative structure? draw/show graph
What kind of story can you tell with your work?
*  what is the story of your research so far?
*  What are some familiar stories in research in your field
    * Your chronological progress?
    * history of the field?
    * methodological?
        * focus on a particular method that's important to explain to the audience
    * story of your organism(s)?
        * geographic?
        * environmental?
        * ecological?
        * developmental?

What do we mean by narrative?
* much like a book or a movie, think about structure having a beginning, middle, and end. e.g. story arc with the following components.
    * intro
    * conflict
    * rising action
    * climax
    * resolution


**First Activity**
Unpack Molly's video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkx8cLUUxgA (not a formal presentation but still an example of effective communication)

Use three cards to write down three observations you have about this video one per card.
(we will then make them in a grid under the overhead)

Example Prompts:
* visuals
* narrative structure of the video
* main "players" or "characters" in her research


**Second Activity**
Unpacking the visual home base example with printed out screen grabs (Sally Horne-Badovinac presentation). Together organise them into the chronological order you think they were shown in the presentation, and without listening to the talk or any other information, what story do you think is being told. 
* Who is the main character or key player in this work?
* How does the story progress?
Other things to think about
* color, pattern size, shape etc
* how does use of visuals aid the telling of the story 


**Third Activity**
Story boarding
* What is YOUR main character?
* What key players or pieces of information  need to be introduced to the audience?
* What is the narrative arc of your presentation going to be?

Use cards and pens to draw out you story simply and quickly as possible -> each take turns sharing with the group under the overhead. **OR** give cards to a partner and they have to try explain what is going on?







## ideas
* unpack an example
    * models in scicomm channel
    * others?
* visual key moves and the narrative of a research project
    * storyboarding activity with cards
    * draw or write the key moves in their research story
    * arrange those in a way that makes sense
    * intro > conflict > climax > resolution
    * how to our presentations fall into that story arc
* prompt
    * what is the story of your research so far
    * chronological?
    * story of the organism?
        * geographic?
        * ecological?
        * process?
    * focusing on a particular method that's important to explain to the audience
    * history of the field
        * the question everyone has 
        * or I had
        * molly's video falls into this category
* familiar story structures
    * what are we familiar with
    * how could your story fit into these structures

## structure
* unpack videos
* storyboard/story structure
* who's your main character

## prep
* arianna decide what emily should do :)
