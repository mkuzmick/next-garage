# GENED 1001 Responding to Student Creative Projects Session

## the plan
* unpacking some former GENED 1001 student projects: How would you comment on these?
    * Yosuf, Jadyn, Christina
    * Dash Chin
    * others Prof. Bazanna remembers?
* disscussion of how to give feedback on these projects that helps students understand their successful moments/moves
    * and why that’s so important even in the academic writing context (i.e., it can be really hard to know WHY something is really good writing when it’s so intuitive for advanced researchers like grad students and faculty!)
    * what challenges do you have when trying to explain the "good" moves in academic writing?
    * what would those moves look like in a multimodal form?
    * think about how the structure/organization can change in multimodal form - these forms can do things that academic writing can't (i.e., primary source data in serial podcast comes FIRST)
* what it means to make rigorous, appropriately contextualized, evidence-supported claims in multimodal forms
* what does the "machine" of the video essay do?
