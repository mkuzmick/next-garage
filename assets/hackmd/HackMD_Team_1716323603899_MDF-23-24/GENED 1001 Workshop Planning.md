## prompt elitza gave students for presentations
* 1) A one-to-two-sentence ‘mission statement’ for your entire final project. A mission statement is not merely a description. Rather, it articulates the project’s larger purpose; it connects the “what” to the “why.” As with most academic work, the process is just as important as the product – if not more so. Push yourself to generate a mission statement that reflects – clearly, accurately, and with appropriate nuance – your intellectual project.
* Consider as well:
    * a. What are the images and motifs appearing in the project?
    * b. Are these images and motifs deployed in an effective way?
    * c. What other images and motifs could be added, and what could be left out?
* 2) Two to three specific questions for your audience. Presenting work-in-progress gives you a chance to solicit feedback from your peers and to find out how successfully your ideas convey. Most importantly, preparing to present should help you to consider – and in this case, articulate – the strengths and weaknesses of your own work.
