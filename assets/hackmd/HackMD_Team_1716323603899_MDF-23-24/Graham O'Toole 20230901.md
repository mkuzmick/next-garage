# Graham O'Toole 20230901

## quotes from application

"My field of Celtic Studies, like many in the Humanities, has ample room for development in the area of digital tools and materials, and in using media which diverge from the status quo as both teaching and learning tools. These include but are not limited to: geographic information systems (GIS), web development software, online language learning tools, and podcast creation software. GIS, such as ArcGIS, Storymaps, or Neatline and Leaflet, can be used to display information contained in the historical and literary sources from the Celtic world. Web development software like Omeka, Weebly, and Wordpress, can collect and display “big data” in ways the typical essay cannot. Online language learning tools, such as Duolingo and Babbel, are able to harness not only pre-made language learning processes for better and more consistent language learning (and student monitoring), but also exploiting the power of community in the language learning process by incorporating an online incentivization component. And finally, podcasting tools such as anchor.fm, allow instructors to bring the materials and concepts learned in class into reality for students by creating a visceral means of engaging with a public audience, or the concept of one."

"Prof. McKenna has previously used Storymaps in her course on the Mabinogion, which I would gladly assist with if she wanted to do that again. Prof. Sumner has previously taught courses on Irish and Scottish folklore, for which an Omeka based web project would pair nicely, especially since Prof. Sumner has done a great deal of work in collecting and digitizing Fenian folklore materials in the Fionn Folklore Database project. Students could use the dataset to ask "big data" questions about the corpus. Additionally, if a professor wanted to have a course on early Irish or Welsh paleography, text encoding in XML would be an excellent way for students to learn a new skill and gain an understanding of how other forms of knowledge are produced in the field of Celtic Studies and in pre-modern studies more broadly. Prof. Nagy's course on Cartoons would be an ideal environment for a podcasting project, since the material already has a wide audience, students could begin to develop a sense of scholarly engagement with the public as well as gain skills in broadcasting and script writing, both of which are not typically found in a Celtic Studies curriculum."


## areas of interest

* language learning apps 
* storymaps/GIS/visual learning 
* web development/website projects
* podcast assignments 
* datasets 


## messy notes 

* What do you know already from your departments, if anything? What have you already been asked to do?
    * no specific asks from the department yet 
        * small department 
            * with two dissertation defenses 
        * lack of access to faculty (one uninterested, one on sabbatical)
            * Jerry Hunter and Catherine McKenna are bboth interested 
                * especially in some sort of mapping project 
                    * Hunter 
                        * mapping transatlantic movements of celtic speakers, language, and stories 
                            * Welsh placename sin Patagonia, for example 
                    * McKenna 
                        * storymapping complicated texts and tales 
                            * students unsure of value, so a workshop could be valuable here
                                * cd says this is actually an excellent starting point for a workshop-- using rhetoric and pedagogy to enrich what may seem like a ratgher simplistic tool 
                                    * mw thought: folkloric analysis 
                * graham is focused on leveraging what students are interested in and using it to form new assignments. 
                    * so not just maps, but video essays and podcasts are also options 
                        * especially for McKenna's class 
                            * on the Mabinogion
    * databases 
        * Sumner (on sabbatical) is building an enormous database
            * they are struggling with maintainence, coding bugs 
            * the LL might be a place to ask for help 
                * we may be able to put LLUFs on it 
                    * mw: ai maybe too?
                        * could be an amazing use-case opportunity for how ai could help academic faculty and researchers. 

* What do you want to learn/how do you want to grow this year?
    * skills:
        * graham is personally more interested in audio, then video 
            * would love to learn how to set up his own rig both for personal projects and then on-the-go in class 

    * labs: 
        * avLab
            * will focus on audio
        * eventLab
            * may also be good so he can learn how to run events in our space 
                * but also in the Celtic space as well (which is amazing) 

    * side notes: 
        * graham has next.js coding experience
