# Julia Sharpe 20230906

## [application](https://airtable.com/appER3UOwZSXxxqEA/tblxzbWopU0fJvUaD/viwLPNBOz8mqYyFPh/recKHKI9NDGuRegzN?blocks=hide)

excerpts from application: 

"Asking students to think about films in the language of films rather than in the language of a written seminar paper is something I haven’t encountered outside of art school video production courses (where the goal is not to theorize film so much as to make something), and there is little precedent for how to work with seminar students in this way (even in AFVS). Given its potential for opening students up to thinking in images alongside language, I would say this is a viable option that should be cultivated and practiced more widely in any department; and, as a media fellow I would hope to develop a set of principles for teaching and evaluating the short film or video essay."

"The skills I would bring to the MDF role are practical. As a scholar who has an MFA in filmmaking and who has taught filmmaking classes, I enjoy working with students through the practical problems of media making: how to use Premier Pro and Media Encoder; how to use specific cameras; how to edit sound."

"In the role of MDF, I would be most excited to work with students both on making moving image based final projects as well as on thinking critically about the internet a a form of media. This is something I do less in my own filmmaking practice but know of students in AFVS and at other schools who are interested in using websites, tik tok, instagram and other forms of social media as malleable forms that can be shaped for critical thinking."

## areas of interest


## messy notes

AFVS MDF

Potential courses
* Afvs70
* geneds
* David joselit may be involved in the seminar - usually teaches modernism in the 20th century
* Arthur canon ??
* Matt saunders?


Thinking about what it means to translate an argument into a media context, and whether or not the role of an art department is to actually argue anything. What is the role of an art department?
In terms of her interests, she wants to write a treatise on the role of an art department. Is it to make arguments? How to maneuver with different forms?
Also thinking about surveying the faculty and TFs about what they do with students doing things outside the box and how they guide them. Put together some sort of doc or loose guidelines about how to guide those students and how to evaluate their work. The question might not be so straightforward

Re: grad facing event ideas - 
prob would be excited for a grad facing event
CD: Alt diss, communicating your research in something other than writing
Julia would be excited about and thinks others would be excited about - what would be a diss equivalent that is not just a written project? What would a media or element component look like? What would it mean to be awarded a phD for that media?


What julia is personally interested in:
Terrible at powerpoints, terrible at incorporating images into presentations in her own pedagogy. So that’s what she’s most interested in ?
Good to get a handle about what’s out there on the internet about media forms. Doesn’t know anything about tik toks
Learning about new media is an interest - including short form video
Thinking graphicsLab, but also is curious about realityLab because she’ll be writing a bit about VR. she’ll think more on this
