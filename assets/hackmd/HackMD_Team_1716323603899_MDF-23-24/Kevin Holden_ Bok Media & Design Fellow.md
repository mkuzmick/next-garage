Media & Design Fellows support innovative course development, partnering with faculty and Learning Lab staff to design a variety of digital tools, course materials and content, and assignments for undergraduate courses and their departments. MDFs design interactive, technically complex learning experiences for students that introduce them to the affordances of different media, and they develop workshops and other forms of guidance that help students succeed in using new media to convey their ideas and demonstrate subject-matter expertise. 

## Learning Lab Training

### Pedagogical Training

Throughout the year, MDFs develop their multimodal pedagogy, learning during orientation and at biweekly MDF meetings:
* how to design activities, prototype assignments, and create resources that help students in the particular courses they are supporting. 
* how to develop their own style of multimodal pedagogy as they think through the specific media that align with their disciplineâ€™s methods and means of analyzing data. 
* the affordances of different media and what students gain, intellectually and analytically, by engaging with those media forms
