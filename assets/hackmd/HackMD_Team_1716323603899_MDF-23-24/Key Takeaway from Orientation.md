# MDF Reflections: Orientation

![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F05Q2SRTB0B/untitled_01_14-clr-bw.png?pub_secret=8c3f5000ee) 

In a classroom, no two students are alike. In fact, every single student has particular strenghts and struggles that inform how they learn.

How do we cater to all these types of learners? 
How do we maximize the learning experience per capita?
How do we evolve/keep up with new forms of academic communication?
How do we *execute* new forms of teaching and academic communication?

To help our academics navigate this territory beyond the conventional modes of learning and evaluation, the Learning Lab steps in. As  the MCB Media & Design Fellow (MDF), my role is to serve as a liason between the Learning Lab and the MCB Department. I will design and launch projects to train faculty, undegraduates and graduates in our department in the hopes of helping shape the new generation of academics. (I think Marlon said that today and I felt inspired so I'm stealing it.)

Before I can walk the walk, I had to learn some pedagogy and multimodal academic communication basics. 

# Front to back, and back to front?

During our first week of orientation, I learned how to approach the design of: two and from a learning objective. In other words, one could first define a learning goal, and then design assigments or evals tailored around the goal. So sort of going backwards. Conversely, one can think about what a really cool assigment look like (podcast!, video essays!, graphical abstracts!) and then think what learning goal this could cater to. Going from the assigment to the objective i.e. forward. 

To really get a sense of what this looks like, we practiced both modes:

First we approached the backward design, where I though about this hypothetical course to teach scientist how to "talk the talk" aka how does one explain this really complicated concept that only a superexpert will be familiar with. Based on this main goal, I thought about smaller tangible goals to help ghe large goal. 

Then, we took the forward approach: where we saw example of really cool assigments like video essays. Probably the best stuff happened right after: we all brainstormed different mediums for assigments, such as TikTok vids, Twitter threads and many more. To take it a step further, I paired up with Arianna to think about one of these mediums and how it would be useful in our fields. We chose to discuss explainer videos, which are mid-length videos that include simplified graphics about a concept and explain the concept as you go. 


# The Learning Lab Mojo Dojo Casa House 
As you step into the Learning Lab, it's clear that there is **A LOT** to do in this space. But to make it a little less scary, we all got to play around with the equipment and explore the capacity of the tools here. 

Arianna and I got on stage to explain some scaffolding assigments with the end of better science commiunication. On this screen one could see Arianna and I somehow standing next to our HackMD markdown while also being on the iconic wooden table at the LL (?) I guess you just had to be there. 

# A wealth of forms: 
While I took away many things from orientation, one of the parts that will stick with me is how rich learning can be. What I mean by that is: you can learn the same thing in 30 different ways! Do you need all of them? No. But everybody will need at least one of them. Some may be more popular than others, but they're all catering to a different audience. This realization was ✨magical✨. It exemplifies why we do what we do and how more people should be thinking deeply about how others think.
