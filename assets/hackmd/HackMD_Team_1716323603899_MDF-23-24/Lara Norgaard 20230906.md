# Lara Norgaard 20230906

## [application](https://airtable.com/appER3UOwZSXxxqEA/tblxzbWopU0fJvUaD/viwLPNBOz8mqYyFPh/recjwPDghg86XKIuR?blocks=hide)

excerpts from application: 

"If I were [an MDF], I would work to support graduate and undergraduate students as they gain the skills necessary to pursue... experimental ways of communicating their research."

"I have skills in film editing and experience designing digital initiatives in the public humanities. Prior to enrolling in my PhD program at Harvard, I carried out audio-visual reporting and assisted in English translation...Though I do not have technical skills in web design, I collaborate in a team to design the conceptual structure of the site and develop ideas for how materials can be presented."

"I am also very excited to gain new skills: I’d like to learn how to produce podcasts, which are very relevant to my work as a literary translator, carry out basic web design, so that I could work independently to create digital platforms for my work, and use mapping software, so as to visualize the spatial components of my academic research."

## areas of interest
* Audio visual component of things
* Personally exciting to her - realityLab - she could either go in that direction or a mapping direction
* Cd thinks avLab is more relevant to course support, tho Lara is interested in realityLab
* Cd brought up lara requesting tooltimes on bite sized pieces of realityLab tutorials like annotated map etc


## messy notes

Lara is the COMPLIT MDF

courses/department things - 
* Translation studies class - at both undergrad and grad levels - and doing podcasting classes at some level for those courses
* For grad students there is a new secondary field in translation studies. Lara has been discussing with the fac running that secondary field - there would be great to have a public facing podcast associated with that
* Lara thinks a script writing workshop could be cool
* Also maybe how you present your voice and how you read etc
* And also how you record?
* Maybe a series of workshop that supports this
* TS260 (fall) & TS280 (spring) - workshops for folks in these, related to the above secondary field

Translation happening at undergrad level - more exploratory, open-ended. Thinking about sound, translation, how you would combine music to presenting your work in translation. There are two courses -
Freshman seminar 36g - lara should come in and observe at least. 
Luke leefgreen complit 108X - prize winning translations - lara thinks we can do something with him that builds on some components from 36g or goes in a different direction

ENGLISH 184CF City fictions - lara is a TF for this course right now. Amazing assignments for this course. Second assignment involves annotating map of a city twice in two different ways. One option for a final project is a first person narrative type thing. Maybe an optional workshop since it’s late to the game - but that gives student ways to play around with some of the ideas
Cd said it could be really cool to work at the intersection of literature and how to assess students in this domain, and then think about the forms that make sense for this. So to design a workshop with tara that gets students to understand that theoretical point
Cd mentioned that lara can also prototype for future semesters if its too late for the faculty member to incorporate this semester
Lara asked about reaching out to tara - cd said she can just reach out to her and we’re happy to join a meeting

Lara brought up the workshop Min Ji ran for the pedagogy course. Focused on why you’d want to present your research digitally. Lara heard a lot of questions “how would we start, how would we do this” - you don’t do a lot of those types of projects on your own. Lara mentioned to siriana at happy hour and siriana said she was thinking about a grad student mixer with different stations - chance for folks to connect across departments and where lara is not the only MDF representative and is not expected to have all of the answers for everyone
Complit always has tuesday evenings set aside - complit grad students could be meant to go during that time and other departments could join as well
Cd mentioned siriana working with the pedagogy course and creating a resource about what to look for later
Lara was thinking of having mini resource guides at the different stations, ie. making a website, making a podcast, zanier things too

In the spring, Lara will probably be teaching portuguese. This will be more likely because it didn’t work out this semester, and they’re going to make sure she’s assigned to a class that’s definitely going to enroll next semester. She’d like to do something with video - these classes normally involve making videos, useful getting you to think about the way you sound, the way you’re speaking, body language, etc.
