# Lara's Podcast Resource

## Paraphrasis pre-interview prep guide
### Basic information:
The Paraphrasis podcast is fundamentally structured around informal conversations
with emerging or established translators. Each guest will have a unique interview that
focuses on three overarching segments:
1. The story of how the translator found a recent translation project and chose to pursue that project.
2. A brief reading from the translation (no more than 5 minutes). The translator may also choose to read from the same passage in the original text, or they can ask a living author to read from the original.
3. A discussion of one specific translation challenge or puzzle that arose during the translation process, and a conversation about how the translator chose to approach that challenge.

### How to prepare:
The interview is meant to be an informal and casual conversation about your work, so little preparation is needed for the interview itself. Please do not write out or memorize your remarks, as that will make our conversation sound stiff and written. However, interviews are most successful when guests think about the following points several days prior to recording:
* Reflect on how you found your translation project. This portion of the interview is meant to be a story, which will draw listeners in. As such, try to think about the details of your selection process as a translator. Set the scene of where you were when you first read your source text. Consider how, where, and why you met the author, if they are living. Describe your working relationship with the writer and how that relationship took shape. Or, discuss your experience searching for information on the writer in the archive, if they are not living. In sum, brainstorm some details for this part of the conversation in advance of the interview.
* If you plan to focus the interview on a work in progress (an unpublished translation), think about how you could frame or connect that project to a translation that you have already published. This will allow listeners to access your work when we release the episode.
* Identify a short passage you would like to read. Practice reading that passage in advance of the conversation, and time yourself to make sure your passage fits within the 5 minute time limit.
* Identify a translation puzzle or challenge that you would like to speak about. If the puzzle is a structural feature of your source language, choose one or two examples that you would be excited to introduce and discuss. A great way to approach this segment is to talk us through a few different approaches you considered and then explain why you landed on a particular solution. 


### What to bring to the interview: 

Your translation and the original source text, with passages marked for the reading portion of the interview and the discussion about the translation puzzle.

### Things to keep in mind while recording:
* Stay relaxed and think of the interview as a conversation. At the same time, try aiming for short, clear sentences, and avoid changing ideas in the middle of a sentence.
* Keep the public-facing audience of the podcast in mind. Answers should be directed not towards academics who are specialists in literary theory or your source language, but rather to readers, publishers, etc. who are interested in literature in translation more broadly.
* Because we will script the episode after your interview, the interviewer might ask you similar questions several times during the conversation. This repetition ensures that we have clear responses to work with during the script-writing stage, and any redundancies will be edited out.







# Paraphrasis script editing guide
## Basic information:
The Paraphrasis podcast employs editing tools to transform interview materials (1 hour) into a coherent, compelling podcast (+/- 20 min). Each graduate student guest will have the opportunity to edit their own script. If you need help or support during any stage in the editing process, please reach out to this season’s co-producers, Lara and Jess, and we will do what we can to help!



## Steps of editing
1.	Sign up for a free account with Descript (https://web.descript.com/learn-descript). The production team will share an audio file of your interview on the Descript site. You can reference this file and its accompanying transcript to check how your audio sounds (especially useful when you are in doubt about an editing choice). 
2.	You will also receive a Google Doc with the full transcript of your interview. Create your script on the Google Doc, not on Descript. When you edit a transcript on Descript it will directly edit the original audio file as well, so it’s much lower risk to do a draft on a separate document.
3.	Now comes the art of the montage. You will need to edit the raw material into a 15-20 min podcast, and write some lines of dialogue for the interviewer. The general outline of a script and examples are found below.  
4.	Send your rough draft to the co-producers for editing and suggestions. The script usually goes through a few rounds of comments.
5.	Once this is complete, the final draft of the interview will be created on descript and the host will record her dialogue (i.e. the interviewer’s questions that you have edited for clarity).
6.	Our sound editor will transform the edited footage, a recording of the host, and the theme music into a rough cut of the podcast. You will get the chance to listen to this rough cut for final approval.
7.	Celebrate! You’re all set. 

## The structure of the podcast:
Your episode should reflect your style and the questions raised by your work as a translator. For the sake of continuity and ease of editing, we have a general formal guideline for each episode:


1.	a short hook of about 30 seconds or so. This can be a brief segment from your reading of the translation, or a particularly pithy pull quote from another part of the interview that stands on its own and draws the listener in.


2.	the host then introduces to the podcast–this always stays the same statement:
This is Paraphrasis, the podcast about translation. I'm your host, Anna, and each episode, we'll meet a literary translator and hear about their latest translation project, how they found it, why they fell in love with it and why we should read it too.


3.	The host introduces the translator with the following line:
Today, we’ll meet XZ, a translator of X to Y. Her translation of XYX was released in Y by Z. 
Then, the host asks the guest translator to describe or introduce their translation project.


4.	The host asks about the “meet cute” of the translation project–how the translator first came across the original text, why they decided to translate it. 


5.	Questions and answers about the translator’s journey and the most intriguing aspects of their current project. This should be about 12-13 minutes. Choose your favorite moments from the interview and build the script around those sections. 


6.	The host transition to the reading portion of the episode with the following statement: 
Next we'll hear an excerpt from XZ's translation of XYX published by Y. But first, let me thank you for listening to Paraphrasis, the podcast about translation. We're hosted by the department of comparative literature at Harvard, and we were releasing new episodes each centered on a different literary translator. Every other week, we have a very eclectic lineup, so you'll want to keep up to date here on our website, or even on our sub stack. Once again, I'm your host, Anna Hannigan. This episode was co-produced by Lara Norgaard and just Jensen Mitchell. But enough with all that, let's hear some of XZ's translation of XYX, written by ZZ. Go ahead, XZ.


7.	A 30 sec excerpt of the work in the original language.


8.	A longer excerpt of the same passage in translation (3-5 min)


## Additional resources:
* If you’re feeling stuck, take a look at the raw footage and final draft of our pilot episode, an interview with Lara Norgaard about 24 Hours with Gaspar. You can use this as inspiration and a template. This will give you an idea of how to turn interview material into a slick final product.
* You are an intelligent, exciting person and it will be a pleasure to hear you talk about your work. It will take some effort to edit the episode, but it will be worth it for you (you get to shape the way your work is represented to the public), and for the hypothetical listener (they get to hear about a new work from a passionate translator!). 

## Things to keep in mind while editing:
* You can —  and should —  change the precise wording of the interviewer’s questions, since these will be re-recorded by the host anyway. Try to write their questions in a way that brings out your answers and makes them sound polished and thoughtful. 
* The answers you gave during the interview are the raw material for the episode. As such, think of editing your answers in terms of selecting and rearranging chunks of text, generally at a paragraph level. Do not edit out individual words or short phrases, as this won’t sound good in editing. 
* Consider what you want the audience to know about your work and what makes your project sound exciting. A lot has to be cut, so there is no reason to include anything boring, overly academic, or redundant. 
* You have the freedom to change the order of questions and to combine your answers to different questions for clarity and harmony.
* Our brilliant sound editor, Jordan, will iron out all of your ums and pauses. Don’t worry about those.
