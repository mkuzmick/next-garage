# Laura Perez-Munoz 20230901

## quotes from application
"During the past two years I have been fascinated by how various professors and language instructors are making language learning more accessible by using social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels. In addition to their formal teaching curricula, language instructors are adapting their lessons to engaging and captivating short form videos suitable for social media. As much as social media can be a source of distraction in our daily lives, it offers an incredible opportunity to engage with our selected audience through methods not available to us in our day-to-day exchanges, especially in a classroom setting."

"I’m also interested in working with long form video, captioning, editing information and user experience in the website. I’m experienced in photography, video, and voice recordings."
