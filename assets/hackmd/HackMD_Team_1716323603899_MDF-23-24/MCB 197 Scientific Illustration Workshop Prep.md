### People
* staff lead: Emily + Alexa
* participants: 41 Students

### Workshop goals 
For the students' final project in MCB197, they will be presenting a poster in a gene-based therapy for a disease of their choice. For this exercise they will first pitch two therapies through graphical abstracts that should convey the disease, therapy tehcnology and outcome. Lastly, students will prepare a poster centered around this treatment.

What we aim to help with is the components of scientific illustration: 
- How to do it? 
- Good and bad examples 
- Tools

### Deliverables 
- Workshop on 03/21
- Help session on 04/05
- Resource Guide 

### General
#### Scientific Illustration Background 
As scientists we wear many hats, we are experimentalsists, teachers, advocates, writters, communicators and even artists. Illustration is sort of an unexpected role as scientist. But it's such a fun part of the job and it allows us to think about our science in ways we haven't before because now we can look at it! An now more than ever, it has become more important to learn how to convey these heaps of knowledge in a digestible and atractive way. 

Scientific illustration is the art of visually communicating scientific concepts and information. It combines artistic skill with scientific knowledge to create accurate and informative visuals, such as diagrams, charts, and drawings, that help clarify complex scientific ideas. Scientific illustrators often work closely with scientists to ensure that their illustrations are both visually appealing and scientifically accurate, making them valuable tools for education, research, and communication in the scientific community.

Types:
- figures for papers 
- figures for presentations 
- graphical abstracts 
- infographics 
- magazine covers or lab logos 

Tools: 
- Illustrator 
- Powerpoint/Keynote 
- Drawing apps (Procreate, Fresco)
- Images from the internet 
- Canva
- Biorender
- Inkscape

Skills: 
- Technical illustration skills: Proficiency in using illustration software (e.g., Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW) to create detailed and precise scientific illustrations.
- Color theory: Understanding of how colors can be used to enhance scientific illustrations and convey information effectively.
- Attention to detail: Ability to accurately portray complex scientific concepts and structures with precision and clarity.(Protein from blender (3D model) - see )
- Logical arrangement in space (relationship between ideas) see more below

**Logical arrangement in space (cont.)**

### Activities 
#### Simplify 
Provide a description of a concept covered in class and illustrate with cards: summary figure or review paper. Thinking about the arrangement of things 

From concept they've learned in class (it's about illustration and not the concept themselves): make panels (like the Biorender figure) as in steps or states: 
- Healthy 
- Diseased 
- Therapy
Show multiple representations: 
- Look at review articles 

#### Create 
Transfer your creation to Biorender 

#### Figure examples
Having the experience, let'stake a look at some examples of figures and share our thoughts 

To-do: 
- Have students make a free Biorender account before class
- Check out the classroom 
- ~~Ask the MCB department for the technical support of overhead cameras~~
- ~~Standard layout structure (Resource guide)~~
- Take a picture and post it on a slack and show on the screen 
- Google drive for them 
- Canva instead of overhead camera 
- Big pieces of paper in lieu of card trick 
- ~~Prepare examples for the local arrangement~~
- ~~Make resource for students~~
- Gather examples of good an bad scientific illustrations
- ~~Ask Amanda for email list for MCB197~~
- ~~Ask if content has changed from what's on the excel sheet~~
- ~~Opinions about paper vs course content~~ 

- ~~Topics list: so nobody is confused ~~
- Talk to a partner
- Upload to canvas
- ~~Alreayd having a PPT file w dimensions and with boxes in place with aligned and with fonts already place.~~
- Make Biorender guide for free version
