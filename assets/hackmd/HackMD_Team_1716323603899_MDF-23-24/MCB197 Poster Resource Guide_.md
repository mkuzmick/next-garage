# MCB197 Scientific Poster Design

Scientific posters are a key part of how scientists share their work with others. They're especially important at conferences, where researchers can show their findings visually and talk about them with fellow scientists. 

# Usual Parts of a Poster 
Although this varies greatly depending on the application, generally, posters have the following parts:
- **Title:** A clear, concise title that summarizes the research project.
- **Introduction:** Briefly explain the background and objectives of the research.
- **Methods:** Describe the methods and materials used in the study.
- **Results:** Present the key findings of the study using graphs, charts, or tables.
- **Discussion:** Interpret the results and discuss their implications.
- **Conclusion:** Summarize the main findings and their significance.
- **References:** Include relevant citations for sources used in the research.
- **Acknowledgments:** Acknowledge any individuals or organizations that contributed to the research.
- **Contact Information:** Provide contact information for the researchers, including email addresses and affiliations.

In your case, your poster will likely not have results.

# Font sizes
For a poster that is W: 36" L: 30" try using the following sizes
- **Title:** Use a large, bold font for the title to make it stand out. A font size between 72pt and 86pt is common.
- **Section Headings:** Use a slightly smaller but still bold font for section headings. A font size between 36pt and 48pt is appropriate.
- **Body Text:** Use a clear, readable font for the body text. A font size between 18pt and 24pt is typically used for paragraphs.
- **Captions and Labels:** Use a smaller font size for captions, labels, and annotations. A font size between 12pt and 18pt is usually sufficient.

Other  considerations:
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistency in font sizes throughout the poster to create a cohesive and professional look.
- **Hierarchy:** Use font sizes to create a hierarchy of information, with more important elements (like the title and section headings) in larger fonts and less important details in smaller fonts.
- **Readability:** Ensure that all text is legible from a distance of a few feet, as posters are often viewed from a distance at conferences.

# Aligment 
Alignment is crucial in scientific posters for maintaining **consistency, readability, and visual appeal**. Consistent alignment of text, images, graphs, and other elements creates a sense of **order and professionalism**. Proper alignment helps guide the reader's eye smoothly from one section to another, facilitating the **flow of information** and preventing confusion. Alignment can also be used to establish a **visual hierarchy**, with more important elements aligned differently to draw attention. Additionally, alignment affects the balance of the poster, ensuring it looks visually appealing and well-organized.

 If it's easier, you can use a grid to make sure things snap into place and are aligned.

# Color 

Using color effectively in scientific posters can enhance readability, visual appeal, and the overall impact of the poster. Here are some key considerations:

- **Color Scheme:** Choose a color scheme that is visually appealing and conveys the tone of your research. Use colors that are easy on the eyes and complement each other. Consider using colors that match your institution's branding or the theme of your research.
- **Contrast:** Use color contrast to make important information stand out. For example, use a darker color for text on a light background or vice versa to ensure readability. Use contrasting colors for elements that you want to emphasize, such as key findings or important sections. You can use the [Adobe Color Contrast Analyzer](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer) to make sure contrast is appropriate. 
- **Highlighting:** Use color to highlight important points, such as key findings, headings, or important data points in graphs. This can help draw the reader's attention to critical information.
- **Organization:** Use color to organize information and create visual hierarchy. For example, use different colors for different sections or categories of information to make it easier for the reader to navigate the poster.
- **Graphs and Figures:** Use color in graphs and figures to make data more understandable and visually appealing. Use different colors to represent different data sets or categories, but ensure that the colors are distinguishable and meaningful.
- **Consistency:** Use color consistently throughout the poster to create a cohesive look. Stick to a limited color palette to avoid visual clutter and confusion. Try to not repeat colors between objects that are unrelated, and use the same color for objects that are related.
- **Accessibility:** Consider color blindness and ensure that your color choices are accessible to all viewers. Use [Adobe Color Contrast Analyzer](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer) to check the contrast and readability of your color choices.

A three-color palette, consisting of one main color and two accent colors, can be highly effective for a scientific poster. The main color serves as the dominant hue, anchoring the design and conveying the primary message or theme. It should be a bold and attention-grabbing color that helps establish the poster's overall visual identity. The two accent colors complement the main color, adding depth and visual interest to key elements such as headings, graphs, and illustrations. These accent colors should be chosen carefully to ensure they harmonize with the main color and enhance the poster's readability and impact. The use of a three-color palette can help create a cohesive and visually appealing poster that effectively communicates complex scientific information.

While a three-color palette can be effective, some researchers and designers prefer to use mostly white posters for their simplicity and clarity. A white background can make text and graphics stand out prominently, ensuring that the content is easy to read and understand. Additionally, white posters can convey a sense of professionalism and sophistication, which may be desirable in certain academic or professional settings.
