**Objects of Study: 
Tools for Documenting, Archiving, and Sharing Creative Practices**

**Workshop 1: Processing your practice** 

Assignment to bring to workshop:  

We will be thinking about how the verb "to practice" plays a role in our studio work. How can we reflect upon our practices to articulate, deepen and push forward our creative process? We will be working with the basic question: how do we get from A to B to C? Please bring 3 images that show a movement or change over time, A to B to C. These images can be samples from within the scope of a few hours, a few days or your last three studio sessions. The images should show one object or image as it has changed. 

Workshop Activity:

Students respond to each others work by addressing the following prompts. The students respond to someone different for each prompt. At the end each student image has four responses, each from a different student (depending on the number of students)

1. Automatic writing response to the images you see. (Discuss initial reactions to the work. Did something surprise you? Was there a theme that emerged immediately? Did you have immediate feelings about the work? What ideas came up?)

2. Describe what you see in the image, and what is changing. (Discussion: What is the image, formally, literally, materially? What is the change that is depicted? What is the scale of the change, as in are they minute changes or macro changes? What would a macro/micro change look like for this work? Over what period of time are these changes happening? Have you seen these changes/moves/methods before in the artist’s work?)

3. Choose a few key terms that relate to the aesthetics of the work. Create a pinterest board of like materials/images that are formally like the work.  (Discussion: how do we situate the work alongside other works? How do we find works that help us think about what our work is doing? How do we differentiate our work from others? Can we think of our works as being part of a constellation—constellated within a larger milieu of our work and the work of others)

4. Respond to the work by suggesting a creative pairing—a song, a poem, another image—that you think is in conversation with the work. (Discussion: Can we name the conversation happening between the students work and the paired work? Are the works in direct or indirect, close or distant proximity? Frame these as “responses” meant to ping back and forth—acts of constellation building (In our work shop we ran out of time for this one, so we turned it into a homework assignment)

Learning Goal:
To model how students might close read one another’s work by asking them to respond to these prompts. 

Learning Objective:
To provide a method for close reading work over time. By receiving and creating responses to these four prompts for their own work and their peers’ work, students will practice a method for magnifying on a singular aspect of their practice, documenting how/what was done, and “constellating” it to other aspects of their work and the work of others.

Time: 1.5-2 hours. 

Taxonomy of Learning: 
This exercise engages all levels of learning: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create. Further, this activity engages with Responding (affective domain of learning), or committing to the ideas by responding to them, associated with the verbs: answer, recite, perform, report, select, follow, explore, display. As well as: Characterization by value (also affective domain of learning), acting consistently with the internalized values of the work;  discriminate, questions, revise, change.

**Workshop 2: Caption Writing as Documentation for the Artist Statement**

Assignment to do before workshop: 

Please take 8-10 photographs of your work. Use whatever camera is available to you--a smartphone works just fine. Of these photos, choose one that you feel encompasses the themes and materials integral to your project. A detail, or a wide shot, or even an image of two works in conversation. For that photo write a 750-1000 word caption (approx. 1.5 pages single spaced). We are leaving it up to you to determine what "caption" encompasses. This does not need to be a super polished piece of writing--think of it more as an exercise in the vein of our workshop last week. Please don't take more than 60-90 minutes on this. Send the single image and its caption to the group 3-5 days before the workshop. Everyone reads and comments on each caption and image. Please, if you can print out the caption and write your comments on it. Hand writing often leads us to circle or make notes we might not otherwise.

Workshop Activity:
	•	Students give each other feedback guided by the instructor(s).

Establish the goals for the workshop: 
	•	go through each person's caption
	•	everyone read each other's so we'll give each other feedback and constructive comments
	•	leave with concrete themes to use to talk about and describe your work
	•	know which themes are resonating with people the most and hold on to those (even if your work has many themes!)
	•	edit the writing about the work in response to the experience today (and this writing will be integrated into the thesis)

Notes for Facilitation: 
	•	Begin by asking how the assignment was for them. 
	•	Halfway through ask if we can articulate any emergent themes—not only in the work—but issues and ideas about writing about work.


Notes for Framing:
	•	When does documentation of an artwork guide the viewer’s experience of that artwork? Or, when does the documentation become the art itself?
	•	There is no specific way to begin writing about your work, but thinking about what you want your reader to take away and use that to frame your writing.
	•	Writing is not just a “deliverable” activity; rather, writing is a way to work through a line of thinking as well as figure what you think/feel about something.
	•	Avoid the pressure of trying have one thing to say; let your editing do the work of shaping a text for the audience. 

Additional Notes around Conceptualization of Artwork:

	•	How to reveal and also keep close what you are doing
	•	How to cite/homage the people “who came before”
	•	How do we make our big ideas — or big concepts — palpable, easy to understand and also maintain their complexity
	•	Guiding and describing the work rather than blanket statements
	•	How can an audience/reader access the themes in your work?
	•	How can our voice / tone mirror/focus what the ideas we are describing?
	•	What are the differences between Method / Methodology 
	•	What themes are emerging in the writing before we even dive in?
	•	Articulate the themes early, then repeat them in each paragraph — very much like the phd statement of interest
	•	Viewer / spectator / observer —> do these matter for our writing, if they do, then how do we orient from the outset
	•	Strategies for writing: ask a question, or describe a small detail. Recursively describe and add something new each time.
	•	Always ask how larger concepts like “labor” becomes a theme that is manifest in the work.

	

Approximate Time: 2-3 hours depending on number of students. Probably 20-30 minutes per student.

**Workshop 3: Photographing the Process**

Assingment to bring to workshop: 

Choose an object or painting that you want to document images of for any purpose. 

In Workshop Activity:

Part 1: 25 images wth smartphone anywhere in the LL space 15 minutes max -- 15 minutes discussing 

Part 2: 10 images with the DSLR / smartphone 45-1 hr 

Part 3: discussion with images and note cards highlighting how students have enacted key terms

Notes: 

prep is gathering camera lenses etc. / writing out note cards / lighting equipment


list of moves -- 

rememeber to bring up final workshop 

possible AI workshop -- uploading images to the sandbox chat bot
