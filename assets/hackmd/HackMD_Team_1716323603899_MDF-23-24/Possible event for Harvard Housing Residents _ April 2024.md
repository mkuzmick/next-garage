# Workshop for Harvard Housing Graduate Commons Program

## About the Graduate Commons Program (GCP)

The Graduate Commons Program (GCP) serves as the community and events team at Harvard University Housing (HUH), enabling a connection between academic and residential experiences. Committed to enhancing the lives of Harvard University Housing residents, GCP brings diverse and enriching programming to the community. The primary objective is to host events that ignite intellectual curiosity, promote physical well-being, and contribute to the sense of community.

## Workshop Goals and Motivations

I am excited to propose a comprehensive workshop lasting approximately 3 hours for the Harvard Housing residents community (excluding the dormitories). The residents of Harvard Housing are primarily individuals aged 21 and above, consisting of graduate students, post-docs, staff, faculty, and families. The workshop aims to specifically engage academic residents aged 21 and above, establishing a connection with the Bok Center Language Lab (LL) resources.

Having lived in Harvard University Housing for the past five years, I have had the privilege of interacting with residents from diverse backgrounds, expertise, and departments. It became evident that graduate students and post-docs form a significant portion of this community. One realization that struck me is that many graduates find themselves teaching (TF) at some point during their studies, and the LL serves as an invaluable resource for supporting TF sections, assignments, and more. Moreover, those interactions showed me people interest on divers medias, like podcast production, journaling or video making.

The primary goal of the workshop is to introduce the LL to this community. Events have proven to be effective channels for learning and experimenting with resources. Previous events successfully connected residents with various entities such as the Wellness Center, the Academic Resource Center (ARC), Harvard museums, and even the Police Department. In conclusion, I believe that organizing events of this nature will not only raise awareness of the LL but also provide students and faculty with much-needed support and a new resource to enrich their academic journey.

***Note:** Residents typically bring an individual with them to the event/workshop, possibly from outside HUH, thereby expanding our target audience.*
