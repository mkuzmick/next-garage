# Prediction Project Podcasts
## GENED 1112: Prediction: The Past and Present of the Future

## first steps
* reach out to Drew to ask if he can share the working files from the editor he was working in (Can he share with Alexia the Adobe Audacity files he was editing?) **Alexia**: I contacted Drew but he is away for paternity leaves. He is not sure about still having the Adobe Audacity files he was using. 
* figuring out the chunks of the podcast by listening to the episodes and/or looking at the transcripts
    * how will the interviews be chunked up
    * where would introductory remarks go ("in this portion of the interview, we discuss AI")
    * look at the "Ready to release" episodes for this part!
**Alexia**: Working on doing the sections 

## Update on Thur 21st 2024

Making a own ~5min podcast of Alyssa introducing the class. 
Tim Palmer is the 1st interview to do 
What Alyssa should say at the begining of each podcast: 
1) Welcome to PredictionX podcasts. A serie of interview for giving an overview of how humanity has predicted its future throughout history.
2) Welcome to PredictionX! A serie of podcast documenting and analyzing how humans have predicted their futures over time.
3) "Welcome to the PredictionX podcast series, where we delve into the fascinating history of humanity's attempts to predict its future. Join us for insightful interviews providing an overview of our long journey through the ages of prophecy and foresight."
4) "Welcome to PredictionX! This podcast series is dedicated to documenting and analyzing humanity's quest to predict the future across the annals of time. Join us as we unravel the mysteries of prediction and explore its impact on our past, present, and future."

## Update on Tues 2 April
* christine notes on VanBoekhaven podcast _ 5min listen_
    * not totally sure what the discussion is about for the first 2 minutes (what is the codex, for example?)
    * need to have more sense of the speakre, their research, particularly on the maya, before the conversation starts, as a way to ground the viewer

Notes: 
1st part: Probability of math death of covid/presidentials. Understanding the probabilities throught commummucating them but how to communicated them > Using analogies. Goes in explanation to solve. 
2nd part: predictive system : explanation. 
Ancien time - more Newton 
Train an AI = look at history and learn from that what worked well 
Analazying data instead of planning the data and what you want to do and try to answer it >> design
Models with any mechanism 
3rd part : simulation. Talked to politicians. How to talk about simulation. Beliefs. Q&A. Prediction system depend on a conceptualization system.

Notes: 
1st part: Longitude prize. Book of future. Newton. word is over = screwed from young people. Gap from way it is and what it could be. Why we would never go to Mars = because of war of a bad ruler. 
Could it be an event that will bring peopl together 
Money is not in the right people hands. Where Martin rees will put the money if it had a lot. Budget of agency 
Things to preserve: privacy - which is not. People gave up on privacy. How to be more optimistic = being an activist. To vote for good politicians. 
~15 min = Data+ climate. Weather / climate model for data from the ground. Where to do irrigation. "I give you all the money". 
Balance between investing / protest .. 
2nd part: If budget to do simulation = not hight quality .. if more money = better. particule physics in transition, where groups are part of those = effort = prouds. Academia pb in that work. 
James Webb. Hubble = exception in science. Would be space travel a thing.
Private secto can cut cost. 
Apollo high risk high uncertainties

Notes: Katherine Blundell 
 Research Fellow and Professor of Astronomy 
 "Pedual rainbows" - Rules - Prediction 
 
predict eclipses or movements - according to local expert - what people would expect - god was trying to day something - rituals 
Astronomy - measure time better or communicating with god = unusual happen 
Nothing chinese is because of path of Newton 
Example of quasar and how she approched to answer the question 
Limited in our imagination - anticipation cause no expectation cause no example 
AI - ML - phenomena - skip to data to theory == scepticle to go from data to prediction 
Don't use rules ! 
Human imagination is a key point for AI 
But in AI if you putt those away, AI will be better but not improved understanding

Why it matters who has that car ? - Carbon impact / 3 years garanti 
Efficiency question : responsible (turn off car or turning off tmeperature) - political psychological 
We need disscussion in order to know what will change and save the planet
