## Reflection on my orientation experience
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByrxtX0T2.jpg)

* **Something key taking away from orientation:**
Orientation showed me how to be an active learner while not being sit on a chair and looking at a screen. Through the wide range of Labs  taught, orientation made me realized how diffente forms of medias results in an exciting way of learning by engaging the persons. I believe that standing up and actually manually realize your project make a different satisfaction feeling that I wish everyone to have access to (i.e for essays of final exams form). Moreover, even if I experienced how design can be appealing and active learning, the graphicsLab made me experienced it more (i.e more for lecture classes). 

* **How youâ€™re imagining your work as an MDF shaping the modes of communication in your discipline**
I feel like Astronomy is a field stuck between: 
    * The old way: where the science teaching way stayed the same for years due to its conventional form and respect for the peers and scientist that made the first discoveries. 
    * The technological advances: The first telescope sent in space was in ~ 1962, which is quite recent. Since that time, exciting missions are launched almost every few months. Thanks to those, scientific results, images and data are flourishing. NASA website is an amazing ressource about the media way of learning about astronomy.

From those two aspects, my personal feeling is that scientists could be overwhelmed by all the new possibilities of communicating science because they never learned how to do so. 
*Workshops ideas:*
** Intro to the media forms available to support graphs or 3D model for science communication (visal aid)
** Communication workshop for grad students
** Support group for feedbacks, checkin slides, graphs, animation

* **How, as an MDF, are you going to bring about the future of knowledge work in your field?**
I aim to be useful ressource and mediator person that students (undergrads and grads) can come to talk in order to communicate and learn about media forms. Being an MDF for my department will show to the faculties, staffs and students the ressources available to make learning engaging and exciting. This will require efforts from both sides, mine and the department, to open conversations and project that will lead learning in a different way.
