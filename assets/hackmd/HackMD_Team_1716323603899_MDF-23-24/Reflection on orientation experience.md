### Key takeaway from orientation:

My number one takeaway from orientation is having an increased appreciation for the strengths and value of various different media types and methods for creating them.  While I have always thought of  creating visual media for science as a **cool** idea, getting to play around with different methods in the learning lab was great for understanding how this can be done in practice. I also found it really valuable to hear the thoughts and insights of other MDFs and how the same types of media/techniques could be used in different (or the same) ways across disciplines.




### How, as an MDF, are you going to bring about the future of knowledge work in your field?

I imagine that my work as an MDF can help give students and researchers the skills to improve visual storytelling in the field of the biological sciences. Visual storytelling is a great way to introduce others to the magic and mystery that is the natural world and all of its intricacies. This is especially important in ecology and evolutionary biology where the scale and scope of research done varies widely. One researcher might work at the microscopic level of cells and DNA, while another is working at the level of global ecosystems and over millions of years through geologic time. I think a big strength of visual media is it's  ability to make the complicated and jargon-heavy more accessible to those unfamiliar with a topic. The future of knowledge in our field will only become more integrated with time and I predict that it will be be important not just for researchers but also their audiences to be able conceptualize what is happening over multiple different scales.
