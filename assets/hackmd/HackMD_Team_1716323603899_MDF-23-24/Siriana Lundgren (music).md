## areas of interest
* spheres of responsibility: 
    * music department
        * other departments are well 
    * workshops
    * labs 
        * eventLab


## messy notes

* What do you know already from your departments, if anything? What have you already been asked to do?
    * Siriana is still connected to music, but will help us with mutliple other departments as a returning MDF
    * MUSIC51R: leading a series of workshops on DAWS (digital audio work stations), with focus on garageband and logic. 
        * starting with a microphone tase-testing workshop 
        * then, students will be asked to create a beat under a melody assigned to all students 
            * using a beat pad
    * workshops: 
        * MUSIC97f
            * podcast workshop 
        * EXPOS40 Terry 
            * microphone taste test 
        * FRSEMR36G 
            * mixed media translations workshop 
        * GENED1042
            * podcast workshop
        * HAA99A Senior Thesis Workshop 
            * led w/ marlon

    * cd brought up the need for events/programming for graduate students 
        * Siriana is very excited, as the department has three members in their "music pedagogy" program. 
            * one in particular, who studies anime, would be a great candidate for working with 
        * Siriana wonders how to best leverage technology for emerging shcolars in music (with respect to hiring committees)


* marlon-- other ideas: 
    * marlon says any multi-modal workshops that would be a draw for students is a win, but so is one-on-one help with specific students who have ambitions projects creating a distinct, single "thing" over the course of a term. 
    *    espeically students who are looking for alternate disseration/thesis formats
    *    

* what do you want to learn/how do you want to grow this year?

    * workshops 
        * Siriana wants to innovate the podcast workshops 
            * "how can we make it feel more live?"
            * different genres of podcast 
                * interview podcast v essay podcast v conversation impromptu podcasts
                * mechanics unlying different forms of podcasts 
                    * cd is very supportive of this 

    * marlon asks: what do you want to learn more about (especially if it can help with workshops)?
        * she wants to think more deeply about the pedagogy of large group events
            * what does it mean to structure live events in a space like this? 
                * Siriana wants to build a portfolio of events she has helped create, made material for, and presented
                * Siriana wants everyone to leave feeling like they've learned something and that an events was special and catered to them.
            * software and hardware that can help facilitate this 
        * also, coding 
            * web design coding, to create a visual, online supplment to her applications 
            * she may join codeLab 
            * marlon says she can also focus on coding skills in:
                * databases and resources 
                    * to help facilitate museum/live events

* marlon (other ideas): 
    * helping with EMR133
        * podcasts 
            * improvisation versus preparation 
                * the rhetorical moves and mechanics underlying these two processes 
                * the difference between memorization and live performance 
                * rehearsal time for improvisation versus perfectly written text
            * marlon thinks Siriana's work on different podcast genres and innovative workshops would fit int nicely here 
                * she is particularly set up to assist with the deeper philosophies at work 
        * harnessing live performances to demonstrate that course content has been understood and reimagined by students in a way you can't get to with essays (anymore). 
        * interviews
            * Siriana refernces podcasts that use an interview model 
                * as an ethnomusicologist, she is trained in interviewing people 
                    * she thinks those skills could also be particularly valid and helpful wih these conversations and proposed podcast formats as well 
        
        
### interesting side notes 

* what is the next, cutting-edge format for academic communication? what is beyond the podcast?
    * experience 
        * nay, sensorial experience
        * two poles we head towards: 
            * VR/AR immerse spaces and experiences
            * in-person, in-reality collaborative events
