Media & Design Fellows support innovative course development, partnering with faculty and Learning Lab staff to design a variety of digital tools, course materials and content, and assignments for undergraduate courses and their departments. MDFs design interactive, technically complex learning experiences for students that introduce them to the affordances of different media, and they develop workshops and other forms of guidance that help students succeed in using new media to convey their ideas and demonstrate subject-matter expertise. 

## Learning Lab Training

### Labs/Working Groups

To prepare to support courses and to develop their multimodal pedagogy, MDFs join a "lab". In these labs, MDFs learn the media skills that they need to complete their projects. They undertake an initial learning project that teaches them the core competencies required for their departmental projects.

Siriana was a part of eventLab, whose main task was to prepare memorable events and installations for students visiting the Learning Lab. Part of her responsibilities included? 

Coding SlackBots
Operating Cameras/Lights/Mics
Operating ATEM/the Green Screen
Innovation on existing LL forms? 



### Pedagogical Training

Throughout the year, MDFs develop their multimodal pedagogy, learning during orientation and at biweekly MDF meetings:
* how to design activities, prototype assignments, and create resources that help students in the particular courses they are supporting. 
* how to develop their own style of multimodal pedagogy as they think through the specific media that align with their disciplineâ€™s methods and means of analyzing data. 
* the affordances of different media and what students gain, intellectually and analytically, by engaging with those media forms

Siriana participated in a panel on Student Perspectives on Generative AI, as part of the Harvard Initiative on Learning and Teaching annual conference. Siriana shared her insights as a graduate student researcher and an instructor, sharing a range of ideas about use applications of AI in humanities courses. Siriana also touched upon the constraints that AI poses to active student learning.

### Special Skills 
#### Music 51a: Theory Ia
![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F064Q28D8F8/fall_2023-50.png?pub_secret=6839221909)

For Music 51A, Siriana and Chris Benham developed a series of workshops that centered around learning Digital Audio Workstation GarageBand alongside the theoretical concepts students were tackling in their intro to music theory class. 

In workshop 1, students learned the basics of the GarageBand DAW alongside the basics of Apple Suite DAW beat loops. Students were asked to compose a small model composition that demonstrated their mastery of the beatloops function. 

In workshop 2, students focused on the way MIDI instruments could be used in DAWS, and evaluated when MIDI instruments are more useful than physical instruments. Siriana and Chris lead discussion on the building blocks of good melodies, and students were invited to compose their own melodies to a 12 bar blues form using MIDI instruments in the Learning Lab. 

Allowing students to practice their composition skills using the DAW itself helps students learn both the technology and theoretical skills we demonstrated in our lecture. 

#### CE10: Storytelling and Public Speaking Workshop
