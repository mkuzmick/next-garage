The GENED 1070 course explores the factors that make Earth hospitable to life and examines recent discoveries, such as the identification of habitable planets. The course explore the connection/links of life and planets through geological processes, chemistry, and biology. The course will address fundamental questions about human existence and our place in the universe, as well as the potential risks and benefits of becoming a multi-planet species. Participants gain a conceptual understanding of Earth and its cosmic context. During each section, students do hands-on experiences covering natural sciences, geology, chemistry and astronomy.
