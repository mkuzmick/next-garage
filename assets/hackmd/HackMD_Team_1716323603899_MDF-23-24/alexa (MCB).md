* Quotes from application
    * "While the journal club (MCB 290) was an open event to the MCB community for many years, the pandemic impaired attendance and proper access for students to present their slides. Since, the course is no longer advertised as a community event."

    * "As a part of my media project, I would help re-establish and revamp the cherished MCB journal club. I aim to do this by offering the students and faculty technical and conceptual support for the course. With the help of the Learning Lab, students will learn how to use storytelling to convey scientific findings and effectively translate that story onto a physical medium, such as hand-prepared slides. To help the students accomplish this, we can offer a workshop to demonstrate the use of non-digital media to present science. I am excited to revive and continue this longstanding tradition in our department while teaching students effective and creative means for scientific education in the future."

    * "In my training as a scientist, I have engaged in different opportunities to learn best practices in communication, such as preparing research chalk talks, flash talks, figure-making, and peer review.  I have also ventured into creating scientific journal cover art using digital illustration tools such as Procreate and Adobe Fresco. So far, my art has been featured on the [cover of the January 2023 issue of Molecular Cell (Cell Press).](https://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/issue?pii=S1097-2765(22)X0003-8#fullCover)"

## Messy Notes

* What do you know already from your department, if anything? What have you already been asked to do?

* has met with the head of the department, Rachelle
    * Alexa wants to revive MCB290's poster and visual communication projects
        * specifically the MCB journal club 
            * it was a dynamic, phsyical display of science, incorporating hand-drawn slides and other forms of media/presentation 
                * very similar to the LL's main table, with overhead views
            * Alexa thinks having support similar to the LL would make a huge difference 
            * she is also interested in wokring on a "chalk-talk," which is still required for a qualifying exams"
    * she has also asked about the department's needs for graduate student programing 
        * they are taking a huge step back from science comm, and focusing more on analysis 
            * christine asked for a deeper breakdown 
                * professors are pushing for students to learn more about how to "think" about the science (interpretation, analysis) as opposed to how to communicate. 
        * they are also revamping 291 as well, but pulling in new faculty and restructuring 

    * chalk-talk specifics: 
        * christine proposed developing a session/workshop on chalk talks? 
            * Alexa said definitely there’s a huge need for that
        * christine asked what skills are needed for a chalktalk
            * Visual storytelling
            * simplifying/distilling to what’s the least amount of info you need to know to understand X or Y. can i explain this to a 5 year old. 
            * aesthetics


* What are you hoping to get out of your time learning here as an mdf? Tools/forms you are already thinking about?
    * which lab?
        * 3D models created in blender is becoming increasingly important in the field 
            * Alexa wants to develop that skill set, so maybe realityLab
        * however, she's also attracted to graphic design and visual storytelling, so is also considering graphicsLab
        * christine suggests she goes to both optional sessions asks questions, and decides which lab she wants to do a "deep dive" on-- there are other ways to do other interests outside of lab, so no stress just picking one. 

    * any other goals?
        * becoming a better educator, a better communicator. looking forward to working with undergrads. 
    * biggest takeaways from this past week?
        * pedagogical theory 
        * ai 
    * other work 
        * christine asked about the g4 symposium: 
            * alexa and her lab partner are considering giving a "chill" symposium where they can practice different forms of communication in a safe environment with one another 


## TO-DOs 

* Reach out about a meeting with these courses: 
    * MCB290 
    * MCB291
        * reminding them about MDF support from last year 
        * reaching out while the process of finalizing the course is still plastic
