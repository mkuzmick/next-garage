# alexia and tori's j-term course lookbook
# Sailing the Universe: the Astronomy and Art History of Our Solar System

# Aims 
* ## Sailing the Universe will teach students how to engage with and present using mix media (i.e. incorporating various digital tools). The course dwells at the interdisciplinary intersection between science and art. From cave drawings and structural archaeological evidence to engraved prints, frescoed wall paintings, and oil painted canvases, the subject of the solar system has captured the attention of humans since seemingly the begining of time. The solar system has woven its way into visual programs across historical periods, culture and geographic space. At every phase of technological advancement, it seems that a concerted effort was made to channel such technology into observing and improving our observations of the solar system with the ambition to better understand our place amongst the stars. This JTerm course would only be able to capture a tiny bite sized glipse into the perplexing magic of the universe through through combining studies about the astronomy (physics and chemistry) with studies about the visual legacy of solar system images. The couse aims to bring traditional methods of visualizing the solar system into innovative, modern digital formats, mediums, and platforms  .

# Themes : 
* Sun 
* Moon 
* Stars and (celestial bodies/phenomena)
* Planets 
> Lectures will be broken down by themes and consist of one half astronomy and one half art history. 
> Labs they will be in groups to create a multi-modal final project about a chosen theme. 
> We are thinking they create an interactive 3D model (planetary/solar body with an artwork/site?) And then craft a presentation that we cast their 3D model on the green screen and then they present what they have learned about the planet and historical human understandings, representations, and mythologies of this aspect of the solar system.

> How is the J-term only possible becasue we have two MDFs? 
> being able to use (somewhate simultanesously) numerous digital interfaces -- 3d modeling, graphic software, cameras--combined with hands on thinking. 
> Using the materials and surface to teach/help students to think by doing, to think by making, to think together with their peers rather than traditional methods of thinking by writing or reading.

## an example : Solar 

Sleeping Vishnu at Udaiyagiri or Konarak Sun Temple.
Maya Moon Temple 

## Example : planet 
abstraction through figuration. 
    How have planets been personified. Does this connect to the color systems assigned to planets?

> Early Roman coin image of Neptute dating to 76 BCE now in the Harvard Art Museums collection. He wears a laurel wreath on the verso with a boy riding a dolphin on the reverse. We are used to later imagery that conflates the two (i.e. Neptune with/riding a dolphin) but on this object, the dolphin is indirectly in visual conversation with him. We can also consider Apollo who is connected to the sun and also has a dolphin in his iconography.) Dolphins are a visual metaphor to the maritime culture, prominent seascape that contributed significantly to the economic prospertity and cultural diversity of ancient roman empire.)
> #### potential to do a HAM study room section and pull images from the HAM collection for the students to go see.
> By and large, astronomical systems and imagery that we mostly encounter today stem from the the greek and later roman empires. However when we rewind to earllllly Greek culture (coming from ancient mesopotamia days) there was incredibly close contact with India and northern south asia. Hence Indo-Aryan mythology and the similarities/overlap between Sanskrit and ancient Greek langauges.There is probably something in thinking about solar system observations, the creations of mythologies and visual traditions/iconographies.   
## Example Moon
