# celtic workshops planning

## notes
* first session: data landscape/tools in celtic studies and adjacent worlds
    * what is data and how can I use it to benefit myself in more creative ways, using more advanced tools
    * sharepoint in celtic has digital resources
    * celtic studies association of north america has something similar
    * graham working on finding more tools and plugging those in where he can
* second session: data, cont'd
    * what is data
    * data management
    * how do you use data
    * have one really good model to use as an example for them to use/pick out data and define data points
    * ex.: a data point might be a manuscript, a quote
    * do a high-level/distant reading versus close-reading discussion
    * what happens when you shift your data so that one thing becomes more significant than another (like, why center the author as opposed to something else)
* third session: podcasts, video essays, AI augmentations
    * will want help from mm-scholarship folks!
    * and probably cd/some LL staff to help facilitate session
    * fcpx - a little taste of editing in addition to unpacking something together
