## notes
* MDFs can attend office hours with DAS so check these out!
    * 2nd and 4th Friday of every month, 10 am - 12 pm
* write to them anytime: digitalaccessibility@harvard.edu
* DAS also has tons of trainings
    * captioning
    * html + css
    * accessibility for content creators
    * and others! check their website
* accessible = same time, same ease of use
* if we think about accesibility from the start, we can make most digital experiences pretty equitable
* DAS policies
    * when working on something new, want to think about accessibility from the start
    * includes technology purchased
    * pertains to both public-facing and password-protected content
* alt text
    * "alternative" to the image
    * describes what's there
    * succinct and contextual
    * allows someone who can't see the image to see what's there
    * you can interact with discrete elements when using a screen readers so definitely make sure your alt text does a good job describing the image even if what's in the image is referenced in the article itself
* videos
    * captions identify speaker, non-speech sounds [cough], dialogue
    * edit automated captions in YouTube
    * automated captions in Zoom
    * audio description
        * context that can't necessarily be seen
    * can use voiceover to reference important visual content (can also insert pauses if you make an alternative video intended for an audio description software)
* audio
    * put a transcript where you can so someone can read it
    * make sure it's accurate so it's searchable and easy to find
* document and web accessibility/visual content design
    * headings are really important - they allow screen readers to jump to sections they're looking for, help with cognitive load, etc.
        * one h1 per page
        * h2 for all major sections
        * h3 for all subsections
        * h4 about as low as you should go
        * avoid skipping heading levels
    * accessible text/visual structure in your docs
        * bullet points
        * spacing and white space
    * use color intentionally
        * strong color contrast 
        * color should not be the only way to convey meaning (want to provide other ways for folks to perceive that, for folks who don't perceive color)
    * writing clear and descriptive link text
        * describe where links go
        * understand link out of context
        * avoid generic phrases ("click here")
    * tabular data
        * use tables for data, not for layouts
        * include headers for columns and rows
    * use automated checkers
        * most apps have these
        * they can catch some things (not all), including common errors (like skipping heading levels or not having strong enough contrast ratio)
