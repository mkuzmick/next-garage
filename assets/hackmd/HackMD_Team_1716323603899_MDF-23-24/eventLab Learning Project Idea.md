# eventLab Learning Project

## Task 1: Planning a Workshop
Plan a 10 minute activity for a workshop using one typical LL mechanic. 

Workshop Parameters:
- Use some LL mechanics (pick from below list or come up with your own)

Technological Moves
- ATEM
- PA System
- Using the Overhead Cam
- Camera set up [for live events ]
- Art Supplies
- Manipulating the LL Space

Your task is to learn at least one (likely many more) of these mechanics and then [importantly] innovate on the mechanic you've learned. Make sure your workshop attendees walk away with one tangible *touchable* object they can take away with them (e.g. a sample podcast, a button, a card with their idea, etc.)


## Task 2: Planning a Capstone Celebration
Plan an introductory 10 minutes for an end of year course celebration where students will showcase their final projects in the Learning Lab. 

Project Parameters: 
- Course has 10-12 students
- Course final will have audience of students' friends
- Course final will involve multimedia presentations of the takeaway materials designed in the first task. 

Using these parameters, dream big to envision how the LL can best be transformed to showcase your creations and create an environment that encourages learning and celebration. The celebration can be big or small-- that can include things like button making all the way to creating a festival based on showcasing students final projects.
