# formatting sdx drives

## the steps
These steps assume you're formatting your drive on a mac.

* plug the drive into your machine
* open Disk Utility
* click the sidebar menu ("View", on the left-hand side of the screen)
    * select "Show All Devices"
* select the drive from the left-hand side (under "External")
* on the right-hand side, click "Erase"
    * a window will pop up
    * name the drive whatever you want (MDF_Name, ex.)
    * from the Format menu, select "Mac OS Extended (Journaled)"
    * then click "Erase"


**note**: If you want to format your drive for PC, you can format it for ExFAT.
