# grad-facing event ideas

## ideas
* MCB - in structural bio, need to look at parts of a cell
    * 3D modeling
    * highlight features you can't see in 2D
* in HAA, G3 presentations
    * incorporate interactive visual models
    * architecture, sculpture, painting
    * surface textures
    * space
* Astronomy - timescales are very long, challenge is to show something and often plots are resorted to
    * but having a visual that can cope with timescale and also with scale seems needed
    * gifs
    * challenging conceptual things - many dimensions beyond 3, ex.
    * visual aids that are metaphorical
    * things you're guessing about because they can't be observed
    * department hosts lunch talks every thursday
        * anyone can present for 10 mins
        * everyone can attend (NASA, Smithsonian)
        * workshop where they can train, practice, show slides, get some feedback to help grads get comfortable before doing one of these talks
* OEB - G4 symposium
    * all grads must do in 4th year
    * 2 day event when grads give short talk
    * be able to tell a story - this a key skill students need to display here
    * being able to share intro to a system (especially important because everyone works on such different things and haven't necessarily collected all their data yet)
    * video could be cool here - 3-5 min videos that dept can put on website













## pitches 

### "there's also a Z"

Come to a series of 4 workshops on modeling cells for use in MCB instruction. 

### intro you system video

come to our studio and we can produce assets for a 3-5 minute intro video to your system

### slides clinic

drop in to get feedback on your slides and try out your presentation

### weekly open studio for innovations in communicating X

support group for grad students in X department who are working on a multimodal way of communicating their work (graphical abstract, an interactive website, a digitally enhanced paper or dissertation chapter)
