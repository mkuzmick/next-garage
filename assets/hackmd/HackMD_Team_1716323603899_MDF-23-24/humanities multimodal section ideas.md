* cut apart the text
    * rewrite it
* collective narrative making
    * cut apart the text
    * put it together linearly

        - sequence of found words and objects, collage or video, as a response to the texts, weekend task 

* grounded analysis using a single word
    * choose one word
    * then use that term to structure your analysis/text annotation
* defamiliarize something familiar
    * photograph object from 20 different angles
* Screenshot parts of the texts, distribute the printed screenshots randomly to the students so that they do not know exactly where those come from the text. As a group they have to come with a narrative and when they have to present, we ask them to present the analysis backwards.

* We select 6 keywords that appear in the text, or new words that stand for multiple keywords. Each group is given a word to work with, while they reread the text through the lens of this word.

 
* Students work with the dyad â€”internal and external body, external body moving into the world, internal body, psychological self-perception, psychological relations to the body, while rereading and annotating the text in groups.


* Make a visual mask (of the text)
