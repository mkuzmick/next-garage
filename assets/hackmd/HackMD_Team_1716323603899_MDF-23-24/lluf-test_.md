## Feedback

### Are the instructions clear and straight forwards, how could they be improved?

* Feedback Summary
    * Based on the feedback responses, the instructions are generally clear and straightforward. However, several areas could be improved for better clarity and comprehension. Here's a comprehensive but concise summary of the feedback, divided into sections for clarity:

    1. Clarity of Instructions
        * Most respondents found the instructions to be clear and straightforward. They appreciated the simplicity and directness of the instructions, which made the assignment easy to understand and begin. 

    2. Need for Technical Guidance
        * Some respondents suggested that additional technical guidance might be needed, particularly for those who might not be familiar with certain media forms. For instance, guidance on how to create an Instagram post carousel or using tools like Canva could be beneficial.

    3. Compatibility of Media and Paper
        * It was suggested that the instructions should include a note about the compatibility of the chosen media form with the selected paper. Not all papers might work well with certain media forms, so students should be encouraged to choose a media form that does justice to their paper.

    4. Definition of Terms
        * Several respondents pointed out that some terms used in the instructions could be expanded upon or defined more clearly. Terms like "non-science audience", "Instagram carousel style", and "interactive model" were mentioned as potentially needing further explanation.

    5. Examples and Guidelines
        * Many respondents expressed a desire for examples of what is expected, especially for different media types. This could help clarify what is expected of the students. Additionally, guidelines or a word limit/minimum could help ensure that all students provide equal amounts of information.

    6. Rubric and Assignment Criteria
        * One respondent noted that the rubric mentioned the need to incorporate at least two analogies to illustrate and explain scientific concepts, but this wasn't stated in the directions. Including this in the assignment criteria could be helpful.

    7. Sources and Tools
        * A few respondents suggested adding more specificity about the sources that can be used and the tools available. For instance, if students choose the carousel version, should they create their own images or can they use screenshots from the internet? 

    8. Access to Databases
        * One respondent suggested including some databases where students could search for scientific peer-reviewed articles, although they noted that the class doing the assignment might already be familiar with good sources.

### What alternative form of media did you pick? Why did you gravitate towards this option?
* Feedback Summary   
    1. Chosen Media Forms:
        * Graphic Design: Some respondents chose graphic design as their preferred media form, creating graphics on platforms like Canva.
        * Instagram Slides: Several respondents gravitated towards Instagram slides, which allow for a combination of text and images.
        * Short Videos: A number of respondents chose to create a 1-minute video, similar to those found on TikTok.

    2. Reasons for Choosing Media Forms:
        * Effectiveness in Conveying Information: Respondents who chose graphic design or Instagram slides believed these forms would effectively show progressions or physical changes, or convey information without being too overbearing.
        * Personal Interest and Familiarity: Some respondents were drawn to media forms due to their interest in graphic design or because they consume similar forms of media frequently.
        * Convenience and Accessibility: Convenience played a role in the choice of media form for some respondents. For instance, Instagram slides and graphics were chosen due to the ease of use of software like Canva, and the ability to create content from a computer without needing additional equipment.

   
## A LLUF Prototype:
![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F060GATKPUM/what_is_fauna.png?pub_secret=c3209c56af)
I chose to make a graphic for this assignment. However, because I am just prototyping the assignment I made just 1 page instead of 5. For my one page I focussed on the key results from the various experiments detailed in the paper. These included the initial gene screen that 1. found in the elephant genome 2 genes that influence incisors in mammals, 2. matched one of these genes to a homolog in humans that is an x-linked dominant gene that when present decreases incisor size, 3. Made the connection that the frequency of this gene increased as the frequency of tusks decreased within the elephant population. I chose a graphic to explain this because genes and genetics can be an abstract topic for many people in the general public, so I thought that having images of DNA along with images of the changing tusk size would help to visually illustrate the connection between genotype and phenotype. Furthermore, if I were to complete the additional 4 slides I would have used a graphic to show how the population size of elephants decreased while the proportion of elephants without tusks increased over the same period of time. For me, a key was to keep the graphic simple and straightforward, with minimal text needed to convey the discoveries. I also wanted the design itself to be playful and welcoming, hence the soft font and welcoming green color scheme. 


#### Are there any steps in what we are requesting that could be particularly challenging?
I think something that could be challenging is choosing the right form of media to communicate the specific paper each student chooses. Another thing that is challenging is picking out the important results. A 1 minute video is not a long time, nor is just 5 slides, so its important to only choose a few important things to communicate. 
#### What kind of support might students want in completing this assignment?
I think students will want support choosing their type of medium. Or at least approval for the medium they have chosen. Maybe include a check point for after students have read the paper and chooses their medium in which they run their idea by someone along with the reason they chose the medium they did. I also think student will want support in translating scientific speak into general English. Student should have someone view their medium who has not read the paper and gt feedback before turning it in.

#### full feedback text, question one: 

* None of the steps felt like they would be particularly challenging to me. The assignment looks pretty straightforward to understand and begin to do. The only thing I had to look up was what disseminate meant. 
* Folks may need some technical help depending on what type of media form they wish to use. For example, how to create an instagram post carousel (or what to use to do so, like on Canva).
* The instructions were quite straight forward. A few comments I have are 1. should include that the form of media they choose should work with whatever paper they chose. Not all papers would work as a model or video. So make sure they choose a media that does the paper justice. It could also be useful to include a hyperlink to a guide on how to read a scientific paper.
* Overall the instruction were easy to understand and I did not feel overwhelmed reading through the assignment even though I have not taken a science class since high school. However, I wonder in what way the term “non-science audience” could be slightly expanded upon: is it an audience of fellow college students who just do not happen to study science? Is the audience younger/older? This might influence the choice of media the students uses to convey the overall message of the paper. Moreover, even though I am very active on instagram I was taken aback by the term “Instagram carousel style” this might require further explanation. Similarly the term “interactive model” seems rather broad, maybe one could attach an example for each media type (this does not need to actually address the assignment but it could be an example of a TikTok video explaining something etc. to clearly state what is expected of the students). When it comes to part B of the assignment I first lacked some direction regarding what should be included in the artist statement but when looking at the grading overview for the assignment these questions were all answered. 
* I think these instructions are pretty straightforward and were pretty easy to follow! The only concern I had is that since the instructions are a little vague, it would be helpful to see examples of posts that would be good for the project. This could also be done by implementing a word limit or word minimum which would help ensure that all students are providing equal amounts of information. 
* I thought the instructions were super clear. I liked that it was short and to the point - I think sometimes assignments have so many words / random details that it distracts from the actual question. In this case, it was obvious to me even without knowing much about the class what I had to do. Maybe one improvement could be linking some examples with the prompt. 
* Overall, I think the directions are very clear and detailed! One thing I would add is that in the rubric it says that students should incorporate at least 2 analogies to illustrate and explain scientific concepts, however this isn't stated anywhere in the directions. I think adding this in earlier when explaining the assignment criteria would be helpful since all students may not read the rubric. I also think adding in one example project would be helpful to ensure students are able to fully grasp how the project should be approached. 
* Yes, super simple and straight forward. I would add a little bit more specificity on the sources that they can use and  tools available (i.e., if they choose the carrousel version, can they just screenshot pictures on the internet and use them or should they create their own pictures with canva?, what tools should they use?) I also would want to flag that a lot of people dont have instagram or tik tok, so I would put an example video/carrousel for them. I would also put an example of the third option, because I am not very sure of what it means
*  I think the instructions are pretty clear! It might be helpful to include some databases where one could search for scientific peer-reviewed articles, though maybe the class doing this assignment would already be familiar with good sources

#### full feedback text, question two: 
* I chose a graphic because I think it would do a good job being able to show the progression of evolution. I also think it is important to show the physical changes in tusk size.
* I picked the option to make the Instagram slides because I found that that would be a good way to convey information and have text without being too overbearing and then you have the ability to use 5 or so different images as well which is helpful also to get a better sense of what the paper is getting at.
* I would want to make the 1 minute video because I think that is the easiest and clearest way to explain what I learn from the papers. Maybe people with experience making a lot of infographics would do that, but I feel like most people will go for the video.
* I picked the 1-minute TikTok-style video. I find that this is the sort of alternative form that I tend to watch/consume the most. Usually I just scroll past infographics now because they’re so saturated. An engaging 1-minute video can be super informative and engaging.
* I gravitated more towards the Instagram post because I felt that its structure would work well for conveying the information needed. Additionally, I felt like it was very accessible since the softwares/programs (such as canva) needed for it are very easy to obtain.
* I picked the instagram carrousel, because I can easily make the pictures with canvas and can do it all from the computer (dont need phone to film the video) and the third option is hard to visualize
* I would choose the series of 5 Canva graphics because I like graphic design and also think that would be the quickest for me to do.
