## activity
* game design a sophisicated way to think about teaching design
    * don't have to literally use dice
    * but how can mechanics and randomization function within the classroom
    * or instant feedback about where you stand (like keeping score)
    * how does that work
    * heightening experiences that already exist
* take a look at excerpts from schell together
    * essential experience
    * space
    * time
* analyze some board games
    * look at the rules for game play
    * look at the game pieces, the space, time constraints
    * note these and other mechanics on cards (at least 3 - 5)
    * put these under overhead
    * how would we turn these mechanics into a game that helps students learn something
        * imagine a course you've TFed
        * or are TFing
        * what would you want students to learn from the gameplay?
        * what "essential experience" would you want them to have?
        * RATIONALES FOR EACH MECHANIC/MOVE!
