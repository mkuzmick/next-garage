# mdf meeting 20230926 + 20230929/20231006

## updates
* dd + mk overview airtable menu
    * this is also bookmarked in the #ll-mdfs-23-24 channel
    * and is linked in the mdf manual

## readings
* [when/why/how: some principles of responding to student work](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/grading-and-responding-student-work)
* [rubrics](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/rubrics)
* [podcast feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WEGrqE6DNQamfPMjLa11MiGcFeTEYUpx/edit)

## discussion
* what's the best and worst feedback you've received
* feedback is dialogic, regular
    * strategies for doing this with our students
    * formative versus summative assessments
* how can the feedback we give to students be formative (i.e., regular, low-stakes, dialogic, on ungraded assignments) so that they're prepared for summative assessments (and that specific mode of feedback)?

## activity
* think of a course you've taught (or would like to teach!)
    * list out 3 learning objectives for this course
    * what would you really want students to know and learn by the end of the course?
* think of an alternative assignment that you might assign in this course
* design a rubric that evaluates students on **5 nameable criteria**
    * what would these five categories be?
    * what would be exemplary in each of these categories?
    * and what would be satisfactory?
    * unsatisfactory?
* draw a rubric grid on 11 x 17 paper and be ready to share under the overhead!
