# mdf meeting 20231010 + 20231020

## readings
* [Mayer, "Research-Based Principles for Designing Multimedia Instruction"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B08GrQK8YOPdekNQelZSZW4wQVU/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-gIPofZvucepa9MWFXUmC0A)

## discussion
* let's take a look at some of the principles from mayer
* where have you seen these in practice (or not)
* do any of these principles complement the approaches you see in the courses you're supporting? how?

## activity
Design a multimedia tablescape that tells the story of a project you've been working on this term
* Find media on the web and then post it to #util-img-2-md as a visual reference that represents your project
    * this will be the media that you present alongside at the main studio table
    * maybe it's a model you've looked at for a project you're working on in a lab
    * or maybe it's a media form you're really excited about integrating into a course
    * but think about it's storytelling capacity: how can this media visualize something you really want us to understand about your work as an MDF?
* On cards:
    * Write down on a card the course or project title
    * Write a few cards that describe the process of this project so far and what you/the students are learning from that process (i.e., what will people do and why)
    * Write down some cards that explain *why* you're working on this: Why is it important to you and your discipline? 

Be ready to share your multimedia project report at the main studio table!
