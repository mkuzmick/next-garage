# (1) Getting Oriented in Unity: A Playable Tutorial
start with either 2d Platformer or 3d Carting Game tutorial  (for students to choose), play through tutorial, with addtional prompts on handout to adjust other paramaters & reflect on those changes

[4++ computers running Unity; 2 students per computer]


## Notes from LLUF testing

- Skip / stop at the publishing step (takes too long)
- For students who choose the 3d game, there are a few confusing moments that might need brief guidance from whoever is leading the tutorial room:
    - How to find top speed (under base stats!)
    - Changing cart color

## Navigating the Unity Editor Interface
### Toolbar
- On the left you'll find tools for changing and moving around a scene in scene view; in the center, you'll find controls to enter, pause, and exit play mode
### Hierarchy Window
- This window lists every object in your game's scene, and shows you the structure of how those objects are attached to one another
### Scene View
- This view lets you see and edit what's going on in your game
### Play mode
- From the buttons in the toolbar, you can enter the game to see how it would play (NB: any changes you make here are temporary, so be sure to only make changes you want to keep in scene mode!)
### Project Window
- This is where you find your library of assets, and any assets you import
### Inspector Window
- This window lets you see and make changes to any of the properties on an object you have slected; this will look different when you have different objects selected, since each object will have different properties
