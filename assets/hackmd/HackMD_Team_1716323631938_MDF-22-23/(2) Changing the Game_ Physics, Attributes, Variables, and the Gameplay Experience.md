# (2) Changing the Game: Physics, Attributes, Variables, and the Gameplay Experience

Mechanics and physics (10+ minutes) (would not need computers)
- with a partner, select a card from each of two decks: (1) properties/variables deck; (2) games on syllabus deck. Discuss how changing--or adding!--that particular property/variable/mechanic would change gameplay / experience. 
- alternative / second card activity: choose two cards from deck 2; 
- Questions to consider: What would make the game harder? Easier? Would changing/adding this mechanic change the player's experience of the story? Etc.


## Games
- Gone Home
- Dys4ia
- Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons
- Everybody's Gone to the Rapture
- Her Story

## Variables
[tables in main space?]
Could/should this be merged/combined with the Unity museum? I.e., another part of thinking about what Unity can do / what it combines would involve playing around with / adjusting variables?
