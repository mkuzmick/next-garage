# (4) People, Places, Things - Action!: How do Nouns Get Turned into Verbs?

- Have students write out (on blue cards) a set of characters and (on green cards) locations from a game on the syllabus; then (on red cards) draw connections between those characters or locations; finally remove / flip the blue/green cards, and then tell a story that would explain the connections/path through the remaining red cards 
- This would draw on Schell's language of both worlds and characters - the idea being to get students to think about how 'story'(the primary term of the course) unfolds as a set of relations between worlds and characters
