# (5) Dialogue and Choice: From 'Flat' Story to Interactive Fiction
- Give students a few examples of dialogue trees / story structures to explore: e.g., https://indiegamewriting.com/writing-1-structuring-branching-dialogue/; story structures: linear vs branching vs string-of-pearls: https://pinnguaq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Narrative-types.jpg
- Ask them to choose one of the stories they've read in class (can have a few copies on the tables?), start by mapping an interest curve/basic story arc, and then transform that arc into something playable/interactice, choosing either the branching or string-of-pearls model as a foundation
