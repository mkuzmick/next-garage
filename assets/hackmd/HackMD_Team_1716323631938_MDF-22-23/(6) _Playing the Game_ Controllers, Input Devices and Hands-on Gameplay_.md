# (6) "Playing the Game: Controllers, Input Devices and Hands-on Gameplay"

Input device station / Game play
- This could be more of a drop-in / less structured activity station - e.g., a staging area for the tutorial. Students can play around with different input devices with some guided prompts for thinking about their uses / reflecting on the expereince - then can move to the Unity tutorial once a machine frees up?


[game consoles, computers, etc]
flight/tasting menu, could have cards where they take notes. so we need to decide on characteristics(?) for tasting notes

## Possible characteristics
- What kinds of games do you associate this input device with?
- Describe the device (what buttons does it have? colors? cords? what other details do you notice when looking at it?)
- How do you hold/use this? (e.g., how are you holding your hands? where are each of your fingers resting?)
- What feedback does this device give you?
- How in touch with the game does this device make you feel?
- How intuitive is the relation between the controls on this device and the actions those controls perform in the game?
- Is it easy to use? Can you just pick up and play? Or are there new things you need to figure out?
