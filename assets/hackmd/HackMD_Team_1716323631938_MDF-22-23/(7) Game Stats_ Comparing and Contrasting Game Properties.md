# (7) Game Stats: Comparing and Contrasting Game Properties
Multi-game visual comparison station
- On a star/radar chart w/ 6-8 different coordinates, ask students to plot each of the games they've played so far in class + one or two others they're thining about for the final project (including, e.g., interactivity, open-endedness, customizability, difficulty, etc.) Once they've mapped each of them, consider what is unique/different between the games on the syllabus and the others they're interested in (activity to help them start thinking about the innovations of other games!)
- One they've charted out their games, have them put them up on the wall or board so everyone can see the different diagrams for each game?


what are THE 5? if we go with 5. look at schell, video game review sites-what are the typical things they do? we should do some thinking here.

1 per game, next to each other. want to get this data into a machine as well as a data vis challenge (have one LLUF doing data entry at this station?) could print transparently?
putting cards on a board?

## Tools

Radar Charts can be done in Sheets/excel - [example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mc9RMoW6tZOYAs9FioCso7lo7b5kG8Un3g8E5KsfW1s/edit?usp=sharing); publishable, and will update on refresh as new data is added: [example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQeEQMQgBE5Iq9tMn9chbxlkDA7bpde4A-VYIcby3qEns8BryPJiXyTBsPuVte4TejROepKXSwrGvjI/pubchart?oid=1230279464&format=interactive)
