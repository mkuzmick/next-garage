# 20220902 MDF Meeting

## Reminders
* today/Friday: 
    * All Fellows' Lunch at noon
    * Happy Hour at 4 pm

* next Friday, September 9
    * LLUF User Testing/designLab
        * Do you want to user-test an assignment or activity that your department has asked you to support? Do you want to try something out before you put it into your lookbook and share it with your department? 
        * Let Christine know so we can run a designLab, where LLUFs will user-test your activity and provide you with some feedback. We can also use this time to brainstorm activities together, if you know the course or have a rough idea of the assignment already!
        * We'll always use this time to develop some new ideas and build new capacities, so you're always welcome to join us for these!
        * see the g-cal for more info
        
## Microprojects

At this time in the yaer, we launch projects from our meetings with faculty/departments.

From these meetings, we're going to start forming micro-projects and will be asking for your help depending on your interests and availability. (For instance, Carly is helping out a video games course since an ask came in from English. Emily's helping with SCRB since that aligns with her background and interests. With Jessi, we've met with a bunch of people in TDM and they've requested lookbooks. This is often the first step with a client and getting right what their ask is.) 

Upcoming workshops will be on the menu calendar. Dani's going to tell you a bit about these now, but more information will be forthcoming as these events get firmed up!

all this to say:
* at each of these Friday MDF meetings, we'll go through the microprojects that have come in to see if anyone wants to help out with them.
* let us know if you'd like to help out with any of these by reaching out to us on Slack in your individual channel
* set up meetings with us and faculty in your department any time you're ready to start firming up your projects
* and remember to look at the calendar to see upcoming events you'd like to help with!
    
## Lab Manifesto Activity
Today, we're going to start getting ourselves assembled into labs!

### what are labs
* labs are working groups that bring together MDFs, LLUFs, and LL staff around particular learning projects
    * we'll try to do 2 projects in our labs each term
    * we want to try and design learning projects that we can prototype in about 5 - 6 weeks
    * labs will determine one day and time (e.g., Tuesdays at 3) when they'll come together to work on their lab project
    * they'll also join or develop a slack channel to share resources, coordinate activities, and otherwise check in with each other

Labs are a great way to develop your skills while collaborating with and learning from others! We're really excited to see what comes out of them this year.

### lab pitches
* marlon is going to give us a quick demo of a micro-pitch of the sort that you'll design today
* then, you'll have 5 minutes to write down on cards all of the possible learning projects you'd be excited about 
    * take 2 minutes to write
    * take 3 minutes to share with the people around you
        * is there any overlap among your ideas?
* on your own or with a partner, choose one prototype you wrote down on a card and design a micro-pitch for it. Use art supplies and be ready to pitch at the main table!
    * Why should we do this prototype with you? Be persuasive!
    * What are the project goals?
    * What can this form help communicate?
    * What tool(s) should someone be excited about to want to join up with you?

At lunch, we'll pitch these to the LLUFs, but you'll have some time during our meeting to practice your pitch and see if you can recruit or spark the interests of your fellow MDFs!
