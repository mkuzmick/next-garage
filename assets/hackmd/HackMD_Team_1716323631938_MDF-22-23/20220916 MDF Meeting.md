## project proposal docs
* by end of fall, we want project description docs (in your google drive folders) to be good to go. please make to update those docs with relevant information about each of your projects, including
    * course title
    * project descriptions
* these docs really help us track and eventually report on your awesome projects!
* if it's useful to think with us about deadlines and milestones, we're delighted to do that! please Slack us in your individual channels - we are here to help you!


## labs!

here's a [lab requirements doc](https://hackmd.io/_DYHXn6iQ9KJvzCt5a5-_g) that gives a sense of the main goals for each lab, no matter what specific medium your lab is working in. It's a general reference for you to have - feel free to link to it in your own lab docs!

### activity 1: lab logistics
* get together with your lab group
* Name the lab
    * draw it on a card!
* Create a Slack channel for the lab
    * #ll-code-lab
    * just so you know: we have lots of lab channels already, and you're more than welcome to join these! but we thought it would be cool for you all to name your labs very specific things this year!
* Invite all of your lab members to that Slack channel
* Create a hackmd for the lab in the MDF-22-23 workspace
    * within this doc, make a dashboard that links out to other docs
    * [here’s an example](https://hackmd.io/Gy9z_Gi8QL62QxzhC-V9KA)
* Share that hackmd in your lab Slack channel so everyone has easy access to it
* Determine meeting day and time for your lab, and we'll try to book you space for it in the fireplace room or the classroom (or even the main studio if it's available - this is tricky given workshops)


### activity 2: lab launch!
* Think of a moonshot dream product that you’d ideally like to have by end of the year (5 minutes)
    * Share some models of this in Slack
    * Write notes about it in your lab hackmd
* Think about what concrete steps you’ll take together to learn and design an initial learning project (10 minutes)
    * what will you do first?
    * Think about an initial learning activity
        * example: use a third party tool to write a scrollytelling essay; use blender to create an object or a bit of floating 3D text
        * write a PROMPT that can be shared with our staff and LLUFs, so we can work on your learning projects!
    * again, use Slack and hackmd to share your ideas and develop a plan
    * models, resources, tutorials, etc.
        * examples of work in the medium
        * research on tools that your lab might use
    * list any other learning projects that can result in: 
        * some kind of proof of concept we can share with a professor or course
        * or assets that can be used in different courses (e.g., a column for a museum)

Once you have completed your initial learning project, you can reassess as a group to determine your next steps.
