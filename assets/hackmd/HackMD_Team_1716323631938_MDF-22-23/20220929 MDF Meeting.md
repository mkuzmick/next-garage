## show + tell activity

Storytelling is essential to what we all do here at the Learning Lab. It's how we share with our broader community at Harvard (and beyond!) the work that we're doing in multimodal/multimedia communications and instructional support. We're really excited to develop new capacities for storytelling with all of you--and to work with you to tell the stories of your amazing work as MDFs!

Today's activity is about us developing stories about our work so far. TL;DR: Show + Tell!

The most basic components of the stories we tell--given that we work with multiple media every day--involve some piece of media and a short paragraph of text. Think of it almost like a little blog post that tells the story of a chunk of work you did as an MDF--whether it's a workshop you supported, office hours you held for students working in a new media, or a learning project you undertook in a lab.

### the steps:
* Think of a course you're supporting or a learning project you've taken on in the hopes of sharing a proof of concept with your department or a potential Learning Lab client. 
    * Or think of a course you've worked with already! Maybe you came to a workshop - you should definitely tell the story of this type of work!
* Design a tablescape that tells the story of this project so far and what you're hoping to get out of it!
    * Find on the web and then post to #share-your-ideas some models, media, etc. that serve as references for you
        * this will be the media that you present alongside at the main studio table
        * maybe it's a model you've looked at for a project you're working on in a lab
        * or maybe it's a media form you're really excited about integrating into a course
        * but think about it's storytelling capacity: how can it visualize something you really want us to understand about your work as an MDF?
    * On cards:
        * Write down on a card the course or learning project title
        * Write down some cards that explain why you're working on this: Why is it important to you, your discipline, etc.? 
        * Be ready to reflect on the process of this project so far
            * This is the oral version of what might eventually get turned into project report text
            * What are your goals for this project, whether for yourself, your students, your discipline, your department, the world?!


Be ready to share your multimedia project report at the main studio table!
