    * Social Media, Advocacy, and Argument in the Classroom: a Lunchtime Discussion of EXPOS 20: Animals and Politics

## telling the story of your projects

#show-your-work (on Slack) posts contain:
* a piece of media
* a paragraph unpacking it

Sometimes, when you want to do something beyond that (like Anna and Emily) - but even here it's great to post your hackmd to show-your-work.

Last time, we talked at a very high level/synthetically about what we're working on. This included overviews of several courses you're working with or would like to work with or the interests you're developing through your work in labs or with students.

This time, we're going to develop the story around the specific things you've done, unpacking those using text.
 
Today's challenge is to textually unpack something you've made as an MDF this term! It could be a 3d render you did or a scrollytelling prototype or it could be a lookbook, a resource - anything you've made!
* grab some media
* post it with a paragraph unpacking it to #show-your-work
* then, maybe take the time to write a bit more in hackMD, like a blog post style post about your project
* then you can post THAT doc in #show-your-work!


## why hackMD?
Sometimes, we still want to be able to make lovingly created write ups of (y?)our projects. Say you're going to share a write up about your projects (or even a specific project) with your department chair. You probably will want to give more context, description, analysis, etc. than you'll find in the types of write ups that Christine produces about your projects (which are maybe two paragraphs at most!).

[Here's an example of a very thoughtfully crafted hackMd doc](https://hackmd.io/@annaivanov/slavic193workshop) about a workshop that Anna made--that gives a much richer view of the workshop than the LL could ever provide on our own!
