## graduate student-facing activity design

Marlon will talk a bit about Harvard Horizons and the type of support we tend to provide to Horizons scholars but the TL;DR is:
* if you're excited about supporting Horizons, get in touch and let us know what medium you'd like to help with!

Working with a group at your table, come up with an idea for a workshop for grad students, considering:
* How you might facilitate a visual design/graphic design activity that helps grads communicate their findings/research or that augments their analysis
* How you would help graduate students think conceptually about how to convey their research to a non-specialist audience
    * think about an activity around story structure/storytelling and how you'd use this activity to jumpstart their thinking about relying on visuals and oral presentation skills instead of text
* Other goals you might have for this type of session (i.e., communicating with a public audience, sharing research in a form other than an academic paper, etc.) and how you would get attendees thinking about this

JK attempts to take notes:
* Siriana and Chris ran an evening workshop for Music students. 3 students from Music in the 60s and Analyzing Pop Music. They have things built to run this over and over. We will log the courses and reach out to profs this summer. One of the profs emailed back and ased for more resources (this was Kate). We want to upsell them towards something more scaffolded. To design the assisgnment better. 
* Ana did 2 workshops for the same course: War & Peace. Creative assignment option for course. next time prof says she will require these sessions. Prof is excited about meeting about Russia's Gold Age in the Spring. Will work on creating those scaffolding pieces. Will culminate in Multimedia golden age of russia tour. by the time they need to do the final, they will have had an appetizer of all the different options. Siriana thinks she can do something similar for Music. Ana will share materials and ideas with her! Andrea also like the idea. we will crowd source and make this a fun collective project. ==A BANK OF TUTORIALS== we can all share and use! put together a little hackMD with little videos of us. even film us doing the mic tasting activity. Marlon likes this as a project-wants it as records in an airtable and to then populate a smooth scorlling website of collectios of them. ==101 BITE SIZED ACTIVITIES!== and we can get llufs to prototype any of these microtutorials.
* Emily SCRB111. Taking hot topics in stem cell bio. voice over with overhead displays of visuals. JK and Emily have been consulting with the student groups. generating ideas for visualizing something that we can't see in reality.

### Marlon launches our support for Harvard Horizons 2023!
This is really bg project for us. If anyone is excited about helping out with this project. We invite you to put togher a few little animations or stills that you;ve made for us to show the Horizoneers in January. We create assets that go into thier final keynotes. Things in blender, after effects, final cut, etc. 

could you imagine doing an event for grad students in your deptartmnet to help them communicate visually & orally like this. Sarah is already doing this!

Horizons stuff will be happening on. Fridays. We'd like to hep you design something for your departments. We will report on this too! We want to do more of this stuff!!
