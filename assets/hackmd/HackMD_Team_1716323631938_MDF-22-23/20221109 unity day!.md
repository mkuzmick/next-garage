# 20221109 unity day!

siriana made a game in Unity! 

goal: create a package that students can download for a workshop in the spring (like for video games course)

sample levels, sample scenes

[this is the tutorial](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:UPValenciaX+UNYEN201X+1T2022/home) that Siriana used

translate this into hacKMD; put it in service of something that we want to make

3d tools are most useful for us making things to give to people (not necessarily for us to teach people how to make 3d things)

interactive musical exhibit
* siriana excited about building a scene where you walk into a historical site and hear the sound

collective beginner project:
* characters walking around architectural space
    * getting assets in, designing an environment, having a character walk around it
* games that help students do some kind of analytical move
    * carly had idea about how to do research in a library


goal for dec. 2 designlab: intro first hour
* get simple object in from blender
* have a character walk around
* or have a couple of different approaches (based on different tutorials we work on)

models for designLab:
* siriana: god creating a universe from scratch in unity
* one where we plop them in a functional template and they vary parameters
* an AR template so they can quickly have cool experience with their phones
