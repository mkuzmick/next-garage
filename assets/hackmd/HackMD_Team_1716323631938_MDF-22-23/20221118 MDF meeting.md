## looking ahead to j-term

departmental folks: we'll reach out to your departments in January to check in and see if they want to meet; let me know in your slack channel if there's anyone in your dept. you definitely want us to include

I'll also be sharing a mid-year survey to all of you soon! the more specific you can be in your response to this, the more it will help us know how to support you in the spring. we really appreciate your help with this!

* are you around? what are your plans?
* what do you want to learn during this time?
    * siriana - want to prototype the Tiny Desk during j-term, for instance?
* any interest in a "sprint week" on studio set up/systems?

## reminder about labs and reports

reports are coming! in your individual channels :) 

we can think about what the labs will look like in the spring - this will depend on what you want to learn

## your dissertation on a card!

we've been thinking a lot about your (amazing) work as teachers! let's think today about your research! 

tons of narratives are structured by some kind of tension to resolution, a move from some kind of tension or mystery to some form of resolution
* what gap in the research does your dissertation fill?
* what intervention in the field is your dissertation making?
* what new body of material does your dissertation apply a theory to analyze?
* what theories does your dissertation synthesize to produce a new finding/insight?

the challenge: represent your entire dissertation on a single card or a single sheet of paper (but let's try to make the card the thing!)

then, come up with a 1-minute elevator pitch that explains your dissertation.

this is the first activity we do with Horizons scholars so it's getting us thinking about that project, while it's also helping you get ready to support that project if you're excited about that!
