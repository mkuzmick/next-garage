## reminder about reports

reports! sent out to the main MDF channel on Slack. definitely let us know how we can help you get ready for the spring!

## activity 1: ideas for the spring!

What do we want the labs to look like? What are folks excited to learn?

Take 5 minutes to write on cards any things you'd like to prototype and then let's lay those out on the table and talk about what you'd like to make.
* coding/web design (with pre existing platforms, from scratch, and coding for web design specifically)
* discussion post in different media forms (with resource guides for instructors explaining how to implement this in the classroom, and resoruce guides for students explaining how to do the projects)
    * mini assignments! maybe during design lab!
    * each of your assignments has to integrate some form of media (jessi example of a possible requirement in a course)
* andreja excited about developing things for junior tutorials with other folks
    * activities that build toward a final paper 
    * doing these with reading responses as well - TFs struggle with getting students to take these seriously; maybe adapting the scroll-lab activity that gets students thinking about producing reading responses for a scroll site
* collaborative workshops? "intros to" [form]
* faculty petting zoo idea from siriana - getting faculty into the space and showing them what could happen; faculty night/event? 
    * grad night as well?
    * possible to do a faculty happy hour?
* allure was excited about making a promotional video about the mdf program or the learning lab to get faculty excited about what we do here
    * for including in all mdf lookbooks

Let's also see if there are any interesting groupings that we can imagine out of those and think about what those labs might be!
* Web design/web lab - scroll lab transformation
* Filming various modes of presentation (av lab)
* 3D reality lab and video games lab
* TikTok Lab! (av) 
    * designLab where we do a series of "shorts" (video, etc. - to condense, to have context as the green screen background)
    * how do we make students better media consumers through a project like this?
    * audio theory and sonic theory 
* sound lab? going off of tiktok lab
* 101 things - make this the kind of resource (1 - 2 per lab; also work on this during the MDF meeting)
* interest in using mdf meetings for show + tell and building this resource together (but wanting to unpack through lines between projects something mdfs very excited about)


## activity 2: sprint week design challenge

Sprint weeks allow us to develop a prototype quickly and/or to learn a new skill in a compressed timeframe. Thinking ahead to j-term, we want to design a sprint week that will help us take on and complete some of the projects that you all have expressed interest in, like the Tiny Desk prototype.

### design a sprint week!
Can you design a sprint week that would have a series of activities that would culminate in the Tiny Desk performance? (Or you can think of another thing you'd like to do/make! a recent idea we heard was building a teaching studio in your apartment)

* What is the thing you'd like to make? **List this on one color of card.** (Feel free to write down as many ideas as you'd like, and maybe then vote on one to pursue as a group for the purposes of this exercise!)

* What milestones would you set? **List out on a different color of card the milestones you would meet on the way to the final prototype.** For example, if you were prototyping the Tiny Desk concert, maybe one milestone would be by the end of day one, knowing how to set up an interview shot with cameras, mics, and lighting.
    * What would be the deadlines (in terms of dates within a given week)? What would you want to do and when? List on cards a possible a schedule for your sprint week.

* What tools do you think you'd need to learn? **List these on a different color of card.** Consider whether you might need to build into the schedule some time to learn the first hour of, say, video editing.
