# 20230127 MDF meeting

## it's spring (term)!

Now, you're supporting courses or doing R&D in the labs. The goal for this term is to connect **everything we're doing to courses**!

* labs
    * a/v lab
        * explainer videos something a lot of courses and some departments are asking for this term
    * scroll-lab/webLab
        * galleries of student projects something departments have expressed interest in
        * this can also be the chatGPT zone
    * 3dLab
        * helping Carly out with this video games course in English
            * learning Unity/Unreal
            * developing resources for students making video games/learning about game mechanics
* designLabs
    * because of Horizons we can't do friday designLabs this term so we'll do more things that get scheduled weekly
    * you should definitely test things with llufs! it'll just happen when we can schedule it - a good time is office hours if your activity can happen in the classroom or fireplace room
* minis
    * devote a couple of weeks to this?
    * we could invite the LLUFs to test some of these out during our MDF meetings on certain Fridays
    * or you could practice teaching something like a tutorial during office hours


## activity: project check-in

### part 1: thinking with cards
* courses you're working with (one color)
* department asks (one color)
* assets you know you need for projects (another color)
* resources you'd want to develop this term (another color)
    * and courses in your department you think these could connect to
    * example: Unreal and Unity tutorials for ENG189vg

### part 2: show-your-images
* post a picture of your cards
* bring your card picture into a hackMD doc
    * you can use as a project doc and for taking notes in, linking tutorials and other resources in
    * try to find a few models that will help you with these projects! post those in share-your-ideas and embed them in your doc
