## activity

With 2-3 other MDFs (whoever is sitting near you), pick one of the books on the main table and look through it. 

Can you imagine using any of the principles this book is overviewing to create a "mini"? Or several minis?!

We'll share our plans and then we'll ask 1 or 2 groups to run us through their activity!
