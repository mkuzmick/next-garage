# 20230210 webLab meeting

set piece where someone can understand integration between web authoring and coding
explaining how this will help you with sharing, say, instructional materials with students on a canvas site

backends: databases and business logic
frontends: styles, where we see things

canva killer for prototyping front ends
airtable for backends


we need a database and then a view for it


sample airtable base thatâ€™s simplified and that we like interacting with
one that we would use in workshops

NEXT TASK: Build an airtable base that you can use beyond this year
How to get this data into a few different web forms: Wix, Next/React

ALSO: develop HackMD step by steps (CD and MK project but everyone should add to this once we start it!)


minis base at some point??
