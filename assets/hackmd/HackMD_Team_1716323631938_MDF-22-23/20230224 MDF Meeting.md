## updates

## show and tell

Using art supplies, let's make timelines and maps that help conceptualize what we have going on this term!
* what have you done?
* what is coming up?
* what are the forms you'll need to learn how to make if you don't know how to do so already?
* what is your BIG GOAL for yourself as an MDF by the end of this term?

## lab check-in
What are the labs up to?

Post what you've been working on so far this term in #show-your-work!

## activity

Imagine you were running a grad-facing workshop in your department about visually communicating your research (or, in Min Ji's case, using media to share your research). With a partner in 15 minutes, come up with a single "move" you'd like students to make during a workshop like this.
* what goal(s) would this move help achieve?
* what would you have graduate students do to achieve it?

If time, let's try it with our own research!
