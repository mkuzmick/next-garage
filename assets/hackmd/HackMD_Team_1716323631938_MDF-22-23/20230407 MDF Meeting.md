# 20230407 MDF Meeting

## updates
* end of year event
    * May 11 afternoon
    * showcase - all LL


## activity 1: show and tell
* you'll be on the job market
* odds are in some interview you'll be asked about what you did
* can you offer a thick description/unpacking of a project you did this year that would help your interviewers understand the rationale for it, why it was a significant contribution to teaching and learning in your field and how you would take that with you into your teaching in your field

## activity 2: workshop moves you want to learn!
* list out on cards any workshop moves you want to learn how to do in your last month here!
* podcast workshop intro?
* video essay workshop intro?
* workshops you know other MDFs have done that you want to adapt for your discipline?


list out on cards and put under the overhead

if time we can do a quick demo!


## activity 3: learning time?!
* have you started any resources that will help students or other MDFs in the future learn from your process?
* what tools have you learned this year?
    * list these out on cards
* let's take some time to make a resource doc
    * maybe we design a template together that is accessible in our MDF hackMD workspace
    * maybe we all add a list of great Blender tutorials we've used to a single hackMD doc so that we could share these with students who ask for more resources in this area
    * maybe we team up with someone to watch them "drive" in a tool while we take notes on their steps
        * this would be super useful to have for basically any of the Adobe programs
        * how to set up a project
        * how to do 2 - 3 fundamental moves in that tool
consolidating/polishing up resources? or doing a tutorial of some kind?
