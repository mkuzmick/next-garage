# 20230421 MDF Meeting

## send the things you've made to your individual slack channel!
* by the May 11 showcase, please send *everything* you've made this year to your individual Slack channel
    * we want a complete inventory of the projects from this year (which is why we ask you to do this!)
        * title
        * short description
        * link to it if it's digital
        * or some kind of media that relates to it
    * an occasion for us at the LL to think about end of year galleries and how to create them, since so many courses we work with want to be able to do this
    * and it'll really help the new MDFs learn about what we do!
* this will immensely help CD with reporting 
* and also give us a chance to hold on to and learn from the things you've made this past year!


## LL showcase planning
* date: May 11
* time: 3 - 6 pm (and beyond???)
* who can come?
    * Anna (but only from 3-4 maybe)
    * Siriana
    * Elitza
    * Celia
    * Emily
    * Therese (tentatively)


### planning your exhibit
The Learning Lab End of Year Showcase is an opportunity to reflect on what we did--and how we did it--and look to the future! How can we carry forward the work that we've started this year? What processes, insights, mechanics, moves, etc. did you begin to develop? And what comes next?

Your design challenge for this exhibition to is to consider the space of the Learning Lab studio and design an exhibit that showcases your work and serves as a launching pad for next year's fellows. You can use your work with courses and with the labs as the grounding material for your exhibit (in a lot of instances, we docked with labs that helped us support courses in our departments). 

### what should I do?
* **Design a view of your projects** that shows people what you made
    * resources you designed, assignments you developed, things you made in different tools
    * you can print any of these things out (still from workshops, infographics, hand drawn arcs/maps of your workflow) and will have a space for displaying (we can determine + design this together!) 


### example approaches
Your approach could take a few different forms:
* maybe you want to demo a teaching move, something you'd advise instructors to do if they were teaching a multimodal assignment
* maybe you want to have attendees do a move you'd have students do as they learn about/make a multimodal form
* maybe you'd want to demo how you use a tool to make something, showing us the coolest thing you now know how to do!


### logistics
* meta-planning
    * types of exhibitions you would like to try to build given what some of you have been thinking about in the virtual gallery zone
        * like an AR/VR exhibit for Chris and Siriana
    * draw out the space and what you'd ideally show there
    * what media/tech would you need
* what will you show
    * videos from workshops you've run
    * resources you've developed
    * alternative assignment ideas you've developed (and maybe taught!)
    * a demo in a tool you've learned
* what do you need in order to show it
    * screens
    * computer
    * camera
    * something else??
* find on Slack media you might want to use
* for anyone who wants to pull footage for a loop
    * note the date and time of the event in a hackMD
    * send to CD on Slack

### a couple of prompts to help your thinking
1. **Give a max. 3-minute demo of the coolest thing you did or made**, where you articulate what it is that you made and why you made it, as well as how this project could be further developed in the future
    * Aim here to 
        * speak to your multimodal pedagogy - how did working with a particular media form or tool push your teaching to the next level?
2. **Show us "the best move"** - i.e., why this particular media form is the BEST way to learn something fundamental to your discipline
    * set up a project in process that someone new to this form or tool could encounter and get some little bit of instant awe/gratification/etc. (think the 2 minutes of adding a music bed or doing a close reading of printed filmstrips)
    * along side this- create one or two prompts to begin a conversation around this move and how it achieves something in/for your discipline that writing alone cannot.


### footage
* designLab scroll-lab (Elitza)
* footage from French 30 or 40 workshops (any semester, any session) (Therese. dates I know I participated: 3/30 1:30-4:15 sessions, French 40;2/6 at 3pm for French 30) 
* video games workshop (Carly)
* Natural History Museum - January 27, 9:00 AM (Emily??)

### MDF plans

**Therese:** loop of French 30 + 40 footage showing language learning/media integration (on screen or laptop?) & poster with stills of captioning project highlighting teaching moves. overall theme: connection between language learning and language teaching.



**Siriana and Chris:**
VR Gallery using Meta Quest headsets/Spatial (2 please!) And maybe space for people to walk around without hitting things :)
If we could have a Mac to the side, people could also navigate the spatial on the Mac itself. 
We're putting our 3d works [from donuts to maps to globes and beyond] and videos of our workshops/etc. into a 3d gallery to explore in spatial (the gallery that we've been building in Unity/Blender all semester) and will add captions explaining our projects.
Theme: How 3d Interaction w/Objects, sound and otherwise, can enhance learning experiences/sponsor deeper engagement w/object based learning.

**Sarah** 
Display ClassicsWrites and let people click through it, accompanied by the brief description poster made in Canva

**A/V LAB** 
Can we make a montage video loop of our projects? 
Sarah: Parthenon video!
Emily: The Central Dogma
Malcolm: Chalk talk (final recording or clips of him prep-ing mics at the board!)

Alternative: Illustrator montage including
Sarah: penguin tutorial, Greek vase line drawing 
Emily: bookmarks
Others?:

**Emily**
Loop of footage from various workshops/events showing four forms of media students practiced this year: explainer videos, posters, graphical abstracts, and oral presentations. Theme: compare and contrast the different ways we communicate science- how we teach students how to produce these media and how does the audience interact with it   


**Celia**
Scrollytelling document exploring the 'zoom' technique, and how it allows students to think critically about perspective and focus in writing their political science arguments, as well as how this communicatess the contributions and limitations of one's argument. 

**Jessi**
Allure and Matilda running a booth with jessi's stuff
