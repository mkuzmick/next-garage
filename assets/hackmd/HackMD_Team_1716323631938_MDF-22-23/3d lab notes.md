# 3d lab notes

## 20221012
Chris made an animation of his cityscape, adding camera motion and the sounds of sirens.

Carly worked on making the pile of books drop! 

Pumpkin carving is coming up! 

We should polish off our maps and do a final render so that project wraps up.

Prep for video games course - how to develop a workflow that might help students build video game characters
Creating a game asset - here's what goes into creating one; way more happens in game design but today you'll learn make a simple asset
Test this with the LLUFs!

Chris found a [GIS add on](https://prochitecture.gumroad.com/l/blender-osm) for Blender and used that for his map! You can pull from Google maps and import it.

Physical liquid simulator!

Siriana wants to be able to import any GIS map

[Mapbox satellite](https://www.mapbox.com/maps/satellite) another tool 

LLUF Caroline joined 3d lab today!

Use spotlights to show the importance of a site (rather than making objects huge)

A lot of interest around animating in Blender

Elitza working on a ghost tree of a controversial tree that was cut down on the div campus

One challege: how to share these things? especially in the VR zone - students don't all have oculus

Let's animate things next!
* camera
* object in the scene
* adding quick liquid, etc.
* physical properties

### other tools people should investigate:
* AR tools (Elitza)
    * including tools we used during dLab in prep for animation course
    * Lens Studio
    * Spark AR
    * Effect House

JK wants to connect LLUFs to the labs-at least 1 will dock with us and help create the lab reports and tell the story of what we do in this zone!
* we can create asynchronous prompts for llufs to help test any ideas or create assets we'd want to use
* If there are tools/activities that MDFs want to test out on the LLUFs, let's keep an eye out for that becasue we can set up those times for you to try out leading them through some sort of learning 

Siriana excited about building something to convince faculty that 3d might work in their courses
Carly working on video games course in the spring

We want a couple of proofs of concepts that we can share with courses

virtual galleries - curious about Tica's work from last year
maybe making assets that could go into Tica's gallery

scanning/working with objects for music?
video in unity(?) - present sound as object in a visual way

museums that have put things online with an audio guide - Carly wants to find some resources about this
acoustics - move through space and hear different sounds?!

unreal audio engine - max built in to unreal so you can create audio synthesis stuff
manipulate a large pipe in vr and learn how sound gets produced

teaching history - scale and whether 3d modeling can help us visualize chunks of time

timbres on different axes
noise pollution/sonic power - visualizing this

scoll-lab collab at some point: 3d timeline

mk excited about creating tools that help students pass things back and forth; conversion tools

siriana excited about extruding blueprints
or could use the blueprint as a floor and build things on top of it - maybe sound waves traveling



### tools:
Blender
Unity
Unreal
spectrogram 
[Polycam](https://poly.cam/)
[alicevision](https://alicevision.org/)-not sure about this one-just googled open source photgrammetry
[photogrammetry with your phone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIW4XU6Wm8Q)


### Ideas:
- Sonic Mapping of a City: How does sound travel through space? Can Blender's physics tools map invisible soundwaves? Etc.?
- let's do a day on vfx!

### first things to do
* take a map and build something slick on top of it that's an explanation or annotation of what you want to show us (like sound traveling)
    * google map where you drop a donut everywhere there's a Dunkin
    * related to expos20brown
        * harvard map
        * freedom trail
* choose a tutorial to go through 

### prompt
As a first step in learning Blender, one of the best open-source 3D modeling tools, choose a map and bring it into a Blender environment. Create a map that is annotated with 3D objects. Try to think about what type of story you're trying to tell about this map: Do you want someone to understand that there a certain number of historic sites on Harvard's campus, for instance?

Imagine you're a student in a course where you're analyzing the significance, history, politics, etc. of a particular geographical space. Choose a map and import it into Blender. Then, annotate that map using a 3D object of some kind, telling the story of this space and what can be found there. How can you deploy the conventional moves of analysis--but in a 3D form--to visualize (rather than just write) the story of this place?

This lab will be a turning point from learning to beginning to apply knowledge. The carving 3d pumpkins will be the project we will cover. There are Blendr Add-Ons like BlendrKit which allow you import other peoples completed models.
