# A/V lab
## moonshot dream project: roadmap/ framework of a video essay or a podcast that includes: 
1. technical workshops
2. scaffolding assignments 
3. content creation
4. create a syllabus for the final product: consider length, goals, what must be included 
5. also include our own final product as a proof of concept : a video essay or podcast that demonstrates the benefits of this assingment that can be applied to arious classes, maybe the proof of concept example is about our dissertation topic 
## concrete steps to learn and design
1. find video essays within everyone discipline: what exists, whats lacking
* whats good and bad about each (glows and grows) 
* what are common moves made by video essays
2. move towards a template: what are good hallmarks of a helpful video essay
* consider: when is a video essay appropriate as an assignment
3. learn how to manage your material and consider the organizational system 
### proof of concept
* pick a collective topic to work on as a test case: the process of writing a dissertation 
* identify what programs we want to use for video and audio components 
* draft and record a voice over for the essay
* collect images and video clips required
* consider ambient sounds and transitions
## post proof reflection 

## random ideas
* create a storyboarding activity
* figure out//talking to LL to understand how to teach about focal distances & their importance for thinking about visual/AV communication
