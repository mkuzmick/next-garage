    * Spin Off Questions I asked in the interview:
    * What software did you use/what techniques did you learn to make a podast? 
    * how did you decide on "podcast" as the medium to make your argument? 
    * What did podcasting afford you as a medium?

## Notes on good interview moments
Aarya describes how podcasting helped her live with the music in a more intense way, something she could not experience when simply doing analysis or writing about music in prose. 

Aarya also described how helpful the Learning Lab was when she was recording her podcast-- she recorded her podcast here and described coming in and out of the studio to ask staff for help with podcasting software.
