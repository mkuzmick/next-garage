Adobe Illustrator is a software used for creating and editing vector graphics.

## Illustrator Fundamentals
### Raster vs. Vector Files

|  | Raster | Vector |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| What is it?     | Built from pixels     | Uses equations, lines, and curves with fixed points on a grid     |
| Quality     |Variable: more pixels for higher resolution and fewer pixels for lower resolution; resolution described in DPI (dots per inch) or PPI (pixels per inch)     | Can scale in size without effect on quality     |
| Uses     | Digital photographs     | Digital illustrations, graphics and logos     |
| File sizes     | Generally larger (can be compressed)     | Smaller     |
| Compatibility    | Can be opened in many apps     | Might require specialized software     |
| File ext.     |JPG, TIFF, PNG, GIF, BMP, PSD | SVG, EPS, AI, DAE, PS, EMF |

### Drawing with the pen tool
The pen tool is used to create vector paths that can be straight or curved. Curves generated with these tools are defined by mathematical formulas and called Bezier curves. Bezier curves consist of 1) an initial anchor point, 2) a terminating anchor point, and 3) a handle in the middle that allows you to control the bend of the curve.

1) Set the stroke and fill.
Select the Pen tool. In the Properties panel, choose a stroke weight/color and a fill. 
2) Create straight lines.
Click and release to create an anchor point. Move the pointer to a new position, click and release to create another anchor point. Continue clicking and releasing in different areas to create more points. If you want to create perfectly straight lines, hold Shift.
3) Create a shape.
If you want to use these paths to create a shape, close the path by connecting the last anchor point to the original anchor point. The ending point will be filled black, showing the point where you started and finished.
4) Create curves.
Drag to make a point rather than click. This will create  direction lines that let you control the path's curve as you drag.
5) Create corner points (change path direction).
Drag to create a curve. Release the mouse button. Move the pointer over the end of a direction line, press Option (Mac) or Alt (Windows), and drag the end of the direction line to split them.
6) Remove direction lines.
To go from a curve to a straight line, click back on the last anchor point created to remove the direction line.

You can practice with the pen tool with this [game](https://bezier.method.ac/).

### Layers
When you are generating a complicated graphic consisting of many objects, creating and managing layers can help you stay organized. Layers are like folders for objects. Using layers can allow you to select, hide, and lock groups of objects.  You can also create template layers that are locked in place and can be used to trace artwork.

More information on layers can be found [here](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/layers.html).

### Masking
A clipping mask is an object that masks other objects or groups of objects so only areas that lie within the shape are visible.
1) Create the object you want to use as the mask.
2) Move the clipping path above the objects you want to mask in the stacking order.
3) Select the clipping path and the objects you want to mask.
4) Choose Object > Clipping Mask > Make.
 
More information on masking can be found [here](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/clipping-masks.html).

### Combining Objects
* Pathfinder effects
    * Combine multiple objects using interaction nodes. You can't edit the interactions between objects.
* Compound shapes
    * Combine multiple objects and specify how each object interacts with the other objects: add, subtract, intersect, exclude
* Compound paths
    * Use an object to cut a hole in another object

More information on combining objects can be found [here](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/combining-objects.html).

### Gradients
You can apply a gradient to the stroke or fill of selected artwork.
1) In the properties panel, click the Fill color or Stroke color.
2) Select the black/white gradient swatch. 
3) Click Gradient Options to open the Gradient panel. You can adjust the type of gradient, the angle of the gradient, the colors in the gradient, etc. There is a gradient slider towards the bottom of the panel with circles below it (color stops) that represent the colors in the gradient.
4) Adjust the colors in the gradient by double-clicking on a color stop.
5) Add a color to the gradient by clicking just below the gradient slider.
6) Drag the color stops to adjust how the gradient blends.
7) Remove a color stop by clicking on it and then clicking the trash can symbol or by dragging the stop away from the slider.
8) You can also modify the gradient in the artwork. Select the Gradient tool and then use gradient annotator that appears to change colors, blending, etc.
9) Reverse colors in a gradient with the Reverse Gradient button in the Gradient panel.
10) Change the gradient type (linear, radial, or freeform) in the Gradient panel.

More information on gradients can be found [here](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/color-gradients.html).

### Blending
A blend is series of intermediate objects and colors between two or more selected objects.
1. Select the Blend tool
2. Click on each object or path
3. Click the Blend too again
4. Control the number of steps or distance between steps by opening Blend options
5. Alternatively: select the objects you want to blend. Choose Object>Blend>Make
