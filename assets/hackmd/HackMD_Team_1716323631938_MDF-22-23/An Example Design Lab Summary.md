# An Example Design Lab Summary
## Friday, 11/4:
### w/ avLab

#### Three Stations

- Audio
– Using Logic to make loops to accompany description and explanation of a topic
– Microphone to project and record
– Video to record


- Overhead Camera
– Using visual representation / physical objects to convey ideas
– Illustration with cards
– Materials; engagement of the senses


- Small Studio
– Multimodal presentation
– Text-based display/description of information
– Speaking to camera
– Projection on cloth screen

Imagine how these forms would be best suited to variety of content AND to variety of audience — in particular, audiences of range of knowledge and ability — (stations were broken down by novice and expert)


.
##### Some Reflections: 
- "content" was generally meta
- the multiform mode (w/ overhead camera, in particular) might be especially useful for teaching or explaining complex topics with moving pieces [llufs gave critical theory as an example]
- the Logic loop might work best as holistic *narrative*, perhaps as general overview or as review of topic (and as final project)
- narration can help synthesize — and REnarration also helps with content "retention" (particularly, in, say, a history course; causality and sequential dates)
- the Small Studio activity (perhaps unsurprisingly...) contains both — it unites particularity of complex content with linear and spacious *story*
