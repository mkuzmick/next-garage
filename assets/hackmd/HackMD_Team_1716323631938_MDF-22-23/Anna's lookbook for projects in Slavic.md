# Anna's lookbook for projects in Slavic

## Project idea 1: Scrollytelling!
### Scrollytelling
*scrollytelling*: variously defined, but easy to know when you see it

some of these definitions or descriptions:
* when content (e.g., a graphic) is revealed or changed as the user scrolls.
* Also called Narrative Visualisation, it consists of creating a logical sequence of related (data-driven) visualisations, or visual elements, needed to convey a message to an audience in an engaging and effective way.

[An example from the NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/06/books/auden-musee-des-beaux-arts.html), which publishes in this form frequently: 


**Why scrollytelling?**
-It allows for a dynamic, not static, engagement with text (broadly defined)
    I've had a lot of success using tools like AnnotationStudio, Perusall, or AnnotationsX, but those tools mainly allow for static close reading and for only observation, not interpretation. Example:

Annotation tools like this are great for helping students learn to close read, to practice close reading collaboratively, and to have their notes saved somewhere! But, they don't provide for much in the way of interaction, product, or projects.


<b>learning goals for an example scrollytelling assignment</b>
Students should be able to:
* work closely with a text or texts and perform a close reading
* create an essay based on that close reading, thereby practicing the important next goal:
* **combine observation and interpretation**
* make connections to other material, such as visual art
* create a compelling path through their interpretation


<b>scaffolding</b>

* platform analysis 
    -look at some examples of scrollytelling on different platforms
    -make notes about what affordances this style of information presentation gives
    
*  close reading practice
-take a text home with you and mark it up, making at least 5 annotations. no matter how much you annotate, spend at least 20-30 minutes with the short poem. how much comes out of it as you read longer? what connections can you make? bring your marked up text to class!
-we can also add the annotations to the scrollytelling platform at this point, depending on the difficulty of the platform

* collaborative close reading practice 
-using a collaborative online annotation platform **or** with a shared piece of paper **or** by marking on separate transparent sheets and overlaying them, with your group, mark up the same poem. what similar things did you notice? practice explaining to your group *why* you annotated the things you annotated
-we can also add the annotations to the scrollytelling platform at this point, depending on the difficulty of the platform

* making connections 
this could take a few different forms
 -the first is about making connections between texts, so they would do several close readings and work on connecting or comparing them
 -the second is more about connecting to other media, so they would be responsible for finding 3-5 images, videos, or other media objects and connecting them to the text in interesting moments, commenting on how these connections enhanced their close reading experience
 
* dynamic close reading practice & visualization
-print out a poem in 3 different sizes (fonts), as well as the images or other connections you found in the previous stepthe 
-cut out the words from a few lines of the poem 
-put the poem back together, using different fonts, colors, or sizes for words you'd like to highlight
-add annotations to the text!
-using the overhead camera, present it to us, holding words up to the camera that you notice so as to "zoom in and out" or make connections by dragging between words
-either way, this could be a separate part of the scaffolding or could be added directly to the scrollytelling platform



* going from observation to interpretation
-this may depend on the course goals, but it's the step when students would work on making a larger argument based on the observations they made in previous steps. Using the scrollytelling platform could help here, as it asks them to make steps along the way of connection, emphasis, and comparison!

  
## Project idea 2: Virtual gallery
(great idea from a group of other MDFs!)
- Using a 3D modeling template, help students make a 3D gallery of art objects, texts, or other media objects
- Students will learn skills in curating, writing captions, visualizing in space




## Other initiatives or projects I'm excited about!
   * Accessibility: hosting a department training from DAS; working with TFs to make course websites and materials accessible
   * Highlighting student work!
   * Student interview time capsules, especially in language classes
