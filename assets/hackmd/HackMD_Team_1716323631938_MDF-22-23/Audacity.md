You can use Audacity to create and edit audio-based projects ranging from podcasts to musical scores. The sky is the limit!

Today, we'll be creating and editing a one minute sample podcast. This workflow demonstrates many of the tools we'll be using in today's workshop. Follow along here if you need extra time or get lost during our session.

 This will add the file as a new track.
 
 A note: the native form of audio from an iPhone mic doens't import to Audacity, so you'll need to run the audio through a converter before you upload: use this site to do so: convert.io
 
## Manipulating Audio
 
 There are a variety of ways in which you can manipulate audio in Audacity. Some of the basic functions are outlined below.
 
 ### Naming Audio Tracks
 
 1. In order to name audio tracks, hover over the left hand tab.
 2. Click the drop down button. 
 3. Select Name... to rename your track.

 ### Trimming Audio
 
 1. To trim audio, first use the selection tool to highlight the audio you want to keep. Do this by dragging the selection tool from the start point of the desired audio to the end point. Once you have selected your audio, it will appear highlighted in white.

 2. Now, either press Cmmd + T or navigate Edit > Remove Special > Trim Audio to trim your audio. This will remove audio before and after your selection. You can also use the same steps to select and delete portions of audio around the piece you would like to preserve.

3. You can now use the **time shift tool** to move this trimmed audio to the beginning of the timeline.

 
 ### Splitting Audio Clips
 
 1. To split audio clips, use the selection tool to find a point in your track that you want to split. 

2. Next, navigate Edit > Clip Boundaries > Split (or Cmmd I) to split the track into two.
