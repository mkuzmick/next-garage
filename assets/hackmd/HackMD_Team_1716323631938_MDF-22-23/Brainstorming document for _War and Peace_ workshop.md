# Brainstorming document for *War and Peace* workshop

#### For Julie:
Ideally, students will come away from our workshop with a better idea of the types of creative projects that they could do for this course, the affordances of the different tools and approaches, and the pedagogical benefits of each. That is, they should come away with a sense of how to do each thing (or how to get the expertise from us on how to do the thing), but also why they would! We want to help students find the best way to develop and communicate their ideas. 

In the workshop, students will rotate through a few stations, where they'll learn about creative final project options such as:
- podcasting and other audio projects
- video production
- video essays
- video shorts and social media
- animation (check out this animation from our last workshop for the Slavic department):

-  creative web-based multimedia essays (scrollytelling)
- maps and timelines
- multimedia documentation of your other creative work
At each, they will be presented with an option for their creative final project. They'll be given a chance to try something out, ask us questions, and think together about why they might want to use this approach for their final project. 

If there is a tool (or tools) that students particularly gravitate toward, we can arrange for additional workshops focused on just that! If not, or in addition, we could host a Hackathon-style work session for students to come to the space, work on their projects, and get our help with the tools!

#### Student paragraphs:


In our workshop, we'll present you with a selection of tools and approaches that you could use for your creative final project, including:
    - podcasting and other audio projects
    - video production
    - video essays
    - video shorts and social media
    - animation (check out this animation from our last workshop for the Slavic department):
    ![group two's stop-motion](https://i.imgur.com/YDWUMAQ.gif)
    - creative web-based multimedia essays (scrollytelling)
    - maps and timelines
    -multimedia documentation of your other creative work
    
You need absolutely no experience in any of the tools that we'll be showing you. In fact, this workshop will mostly be about giving everyone a chance to get that experience, insight, and knowledge base!

In groups, you'll get to have a mini-training on the tools, try them out, ask questions, and think about how you would use each for your final project. You won't have to commit yourself to any one creative approach or tool (or to a creative project at all!), but by getting a taste of each of them, you'll be prepared when it does come time to make that decision and carry out the project! At that point, we'll be able to help with the tools you do select, but for now, you'll just be getting an introduction.
