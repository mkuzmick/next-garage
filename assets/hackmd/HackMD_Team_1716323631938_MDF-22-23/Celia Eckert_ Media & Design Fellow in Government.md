# Celia Eckert: Media & Design Fellow in Government

## Course Support

### GOV 1008: Introduction to Geographic Information Systems

In support of GOV 1008: Introduction to Geographic Information Systems, Celia developed and facilitated a workshop in designing and displaying maps. Celia's learning goals for this workshop included helping students learn to: 
* articulate how poster design can help effectively communicate with their audience
* apply design principles to their map design within ArcGIS
* articulate what different design elements communicate to their audience in storymaps.
* create a storymap project from their ArcGIS data

The session was primarily designed to introduce the basic concepts of poster design in preparation for the course’s poster celebration at the end of the semester; and to introduce students to StoryMaps to experiment with on their own time. There was no required StoryMaps components of the course, but students were encouraged to use it to share their map work with a broader audience. Celia also discussed with students how StoryMaps can be a useful tool for helping them write their essays, as it helps them communicate the core contributions of their analysis.[You can read more about Celia's workshop here](https://hackmd.io/EzF8Ja4yTKC_YVZgiUSMBA?view).

Celia also helped support a final student poster session and assisted with workshops at the Center for Geographic Analysis.

Media & Design Fellows identify key tools they need to learn in order to complete their projects. They join internal labs to receive training and practice using these tools. They also shadow experienced MDFs and Learning Lab staff as they design prompts and lead workshops. 

Celia developed prototypes and workshops in web-based interactive essays as she learned with other MDFs about scrollytelling, a form used by publications like the New York Times. Celia helped design and facilitate a workshop for students in interactive close-reading and visual analysis, deploying the moves of web-based interactive storytelling (i.e., isolating, re-arranging, redacting, highlighting) as they analyzed a series of texts and images. 

This working group discovered that tools like arcGIS could be useful not only for the presentation of academic/intellectual insights, but also for guiding the process of arriving at those insights.  The group started to develop a list of "intellectual moves," or ways of interacting with images and/or textual excerpts, that can guide students' analyses and syntheses of primary or secondary source materials.
