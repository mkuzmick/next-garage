### Creative Projects in Music Workshop

Supporting students from Freshman Seminar 30M: California in the 60s and Music 159R: Analyzing Pop Music, Chris and Siriana Lundgren hosted a creative projects workshop. Students from any Music course with a creative project option could come to learn more about multimedia forms, including podcasts and video essays. Chris and Siriana led students through an analysis of podcasts and video essays before transitioning to an activity where students had a chance to learn about microphones, video editing, and sound editing. The students also received feedback from the Media & Design Fellows about their specific project ideas. Chris instructed students in an industry-standard video editing tool, Adobe Premiere.

Media & Design Fellows identify key tools they need to learn in order to complete their projects. They join internal labs to receive training and practice using these tools. They also shadow experienced MDFs and Learning Lab staff as they design prompts and lead workshops. 

Chris has learned about 3D modeling tools like Blender, game engines like Unity, and 3D asset creation, more generally. Chris designed a 3D rendering of a river that runs beneath New York City, bringing light, sound, and animations into his scene. Chris also led a tutorial in Unity, introducing students to the basics of game engines and game design.
