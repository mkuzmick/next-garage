# Coordination of spatial configuration of the Studio

.
.
What does it mean to have separate stations and tables, or, more specifcally, what does their proximity and array *do*?

The high butcher block table as displaced or dislocated center
The overhead camera (and other cameras) capture and refract that space outward to other spaces and surfaces

It could be desribed this way:
That table operates as the focal point of a parabola; the projection of "information" from its space could be described as the axis of symmetry, the line passing through the focus; the primary presenter (generally, human) could be desribed as the directrix, the line perpendicular to the axis of symmetry which does not touch the parabola.

Though that table (physically decentered) is one among several arrayed spaces, the distribution of its "content," especially onto the 2-dimensional surfaces (screens, curtain) configured throughout the Studio space, places it in a primary position as point of origin and source of *reconfiguration* of other units of space (more on that latter phenomenon/work later).

Parallel processes at the other tables unfold either independently of or in unison/coordination with one another

Tables and spaces may be (often are) dedicated to different tools, frequently operating as different axes of manipulation of the *same* object

They become unique facets of a 3-dimensional shape, which rotates through, manipulates, or contains whatever object or content is being described or mapped; they are also distinct windows onto that object, providing different perspectives on how it may be manipulated or different axes of entry into its form

*Processes* emerge between the spaces/stations or do not; their coordination or interaction is emergent and entails feedback loop structures

If one "object" (or project) is being explored, developed, or altered, different tools at different stations present planes or modes of engagement that re-form or build or *animate* that object

(For example, imagine a state in which a stop motion film is being explored or in which projects concerning a stop motion film are being developed. Tables/stations. At the "main" table, a short stop motion film is being *made*. This enables participants to learn the mechanics of the medium. And/or perhaps the product will be part of or the whole of a final project. The horizontal plane of the table is the ground of the set. A camera is filming that space and the action that happens in that space. A digital background is printed out and laid on the same horizontal plane but in a different area, under and overhead camera. That camera captures the 2-dimensional printed background (as green screen) and "projects" or layers it as the background of the set happening in 3-dimensional space. The resulting nested 3-D space becomes the landscape of the film. That zone is captured by the camera and projected onto the monitor as the film itself. That is then edited......
.... Other stations)
