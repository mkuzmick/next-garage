Project Overview:
Podcast about the ambiguousness of the term *espressivo* in Western Music. 

Interview Questions: 

* What the process of making their project was like and what they feel like they learned about the course that was special because of this assignment
    * Spin Off Questions I asked in the interview:
    * What software did you use/what techniques did you learn to make a podast? 
    * how did you decide on "podcast" as the medium to make your argument? 
    * What did podcasting afford you as a medium?
* Taking us on a tour on a few details/moments of their assignment that they're really proud of, or find particularly comment-worthy

## Notes on good interview moments
In response to 
    "What did podcasting afford you as a medium?"
    Dacha noted how important podcasts were for expressing the qualities of music that would take much longer to describe in academic prose.
