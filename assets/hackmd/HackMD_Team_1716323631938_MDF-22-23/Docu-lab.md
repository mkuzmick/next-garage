[year-long project](Time-Capsuled-Interviews)   
[initial project](same-interview,-10-minutes-apart)

## Time Capsuled Interviews

By the end of the year, we'd like to generate a **GENERIC FORMULA** for the time capsuled interview model to be used across different courses and departments. This will take the form of bpth a HackMD and a short video essay that explains the mechanic. The formula will include:

- logistics on getting student into the space, creating a project timeline
- ideal question trajecotry-structure (quantitative to qualitative)
- editing workflow
- -interview etiquette


### Learning Projects:

#### Same interview, 10 minutes apart

- 


### Edit between interviews
- only showing them their answers before they speak if you know something has changed 


### possible prototypes
- staff footage over the years, pull up old footage and interview LL staff about it
    - find archival interview with Marlon 
- LLUFs from last year
- set a time limit - in 1 minute, tell me about...

### tools
FCPX

    

features of "conducting the perfect interview"

- observing & capturing process in some way (filming someoen doign a thing, taking notes on someone's paper or creation)
- generating pointed questions
- using the "sound bite" coaching to get great editable answers
- first round interview

*between interviews*
- identify milestones in their process 


### studies and things to practice
- if you haven't **edited** anything before, practice FCPX or Resolve or Premiere by finding a reference video you like and cutting it up into pieces (making a cut for each cut). 
    - This will make you faster at the tool and also help you analyze the piece
    - you can also reorganize the clips if you want to get a sense of their basic categories, how many of each there are, etc.
- if you haven't **shot** anything before (and are documenting a process) then take at least an hour to shoot that process
    - capture from multiple distances and angles (for each and every discrete step of the process)
- if you are making an **explainer** video, either
    - try recording yourselve improvising an explanation, or
    - write a script and read it aloud
    - but in either case, time yourself and figure out just how much you can say in that amount of time
- if you like the idea of recording interviews, let's set up a session on how to light, mic and record an interview that everyone can come to
