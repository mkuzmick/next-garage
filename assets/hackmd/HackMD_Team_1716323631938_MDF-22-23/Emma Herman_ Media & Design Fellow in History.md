## ArcGIS StoryMap: An Introduction to Native North America

![](https://i.imgur.com/3JCkOna.png)

History MDF Emma created a StoryMap to walk students through the political relationship of Native Americans to the United States. This StoryMap is part of a project to design supplementary course materials, including an edited video, for introducing students to the basic tenets of Native North American history. The principles undergirding the project are *reusability*, in the first instance—the StoryMap and video should be usable for different courses year-to-year—and *accessibility*—the materials are not intended to be the the last word on how to think about Native history, but rather to offer jumping off points for students to begin engaging with a field that is not often taught (or taught well) prior to the college level.
