# Expos 20: Animals and Politics: Workshop Summaries

## 1 
#### 9/15

#### Ed came to the Learning Lab for the first workshop of the class. A main component of his presentation was the display and description of different modalities of storytelling in film and video. He showed videos he made that use voiceover, or are interviews, or are monological presentations of argument or data, etc. The primary question here concerned, in essence, how form and content connect. Different topics, trajectories, and goals require different tones, or feelings, or foci, and the aim would be to match them well!
