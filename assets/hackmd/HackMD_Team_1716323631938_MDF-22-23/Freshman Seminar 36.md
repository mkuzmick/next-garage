# Freshman Seminar 36

Ideas:
How does music work ~in translation~? 

Translation Workshop

1) Lead the kids through Tendency Tones
    - what is a scale? 
    - have you heard of tendency tones? 
    - Let's sing? (happy birthday, scale)

3) Also text painting in Baroque
    - Sea example
    - Words can take on specific musical meaning

5) Try it on the piano
    6) Affective (what does minor sound like, major sound like? where would  you want a tendency tone?)
    7) Then add beats and sounds. How does rhythm change your feelings/interpretation/translation of text? 


Gesture
1) lead through body, stretch, warm up
2) what does gesture mean to you? 
    3) Go through common gsetures
        4) Thumbs up
        5) Tendency Tone Kodaly Gesture... 

How does movement show up in the body? Music translates into the body... 
(Give us a beat)
Focus on direct vs affective translation... 
now do full body 
waist up 
facial




#Idea 1:
Modes on the piano
- have students play through the modes via the white keys on the piano and explore their emotional responses. 

Idea 2: 
Tendency Tones and Kod√°ly Method Kinesthetics
- How to the tendency tones we're acculturated to in Western music translate into hand motions? how to we recognize these in song? 
- Have Siriana lead a singing workshop on solfegge to explore tendency tones. 

Idea 3:
- Musical/emotional responses
- Program Music using:
    - PLayers by Coi LeRay, The Message
    - Carnival of the Animals (music goes to poetry then to image)
