# GENED: Archaeological Frauds and Fakes (polished) 
## The Question

How is archaeology exploited or misappropriated to develop narratives of white supremacy, nationalism, and propaganda?

## Course Description

Archaeological sites and the great monuments of ancient civilizations often fascinate people. We wonder about how they were created, who built them, and what their larger significance is for humankind. With the rise of mass and social media, and increasingly numerous avenues for the  consumption and distribution of information, the truth about such sites and monuments—if one even exists—often gets obfuscated. 

This class looks at how and why conspiracy theories develop so commonly and so vehemently  around archaeological contexts. Looking at common and popular avenues of information distribution such as news channels, the use of archaeology in video games and comics, and alternative forms of reporting (e.g., podcasts and blogs), you will explore how narratives of archaeology are cross-culturally (mis)appropriated and deployed to craft certain narratives of nationalism, supremacy, and evolution.
 
By exploring this phenomenon, you will also consider how elements of narrative and authority are related to information distribution. Whose voice should we trust when consuming information? What is the role of academia in information distribution? Is the exploitation of archaeology fundamentally different from other types of fake news and propaganda? 


By the end of the class, in addition to learning about case studies on topics like X, X, and X, you will have a deeper understanding of the role of ethics in academic research, the consequences of information distribution and withholding, and understand the complexities of archaeological mass marketing.
