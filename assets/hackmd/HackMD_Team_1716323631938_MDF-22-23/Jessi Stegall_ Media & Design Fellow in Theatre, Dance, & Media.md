# Jessi Stegall: Media & Design Fellow in Theatre, Dance, & Media

## Course Support

### TDM172: Performing Outside the Theater

The purpose of this workshop is to give students a taster of how tabletops, film, and projection can be used as a frame for performance. This workshop investigated two alternative sites for theatrical production that we use a great deal in the Learning Lab: tables and screens. Using projection equipment, cameras, lights, and other tools, Jessi design an immersive experience for students who were learning about the many possible surfaces and materials that can comprise a performance.

### TDM90AR: Puppet Theatre Production Studio

Jessi worked with visting artist Kate Brehm to document the production studio from process to product. She filmed rehearsals & performances, and conducted a filmed interview with Kate and her TA about the process of developing the show. She is editing this footage together to create a short process film for Kate & TDM. Additionally, Jessi hosted a session for Kate & her students at the learning lab to transfer their developing puppetry skills into a digital format using the studio green screen.


### TDM98: Junior Capstone Tutorial

Jessi developed and led a workshop for TDM98 students, leading them through a series of Learning Lab "tasters" that invited them to use different mediums to develop their ideas for their senior thesis projects, as well as get a taste of the different ways the Learning Lab can be a resource for them when they are working on their senior thesis projects next year. During the workshop, students experimented with creating music loops on Logic Pro, prototyping mini set models, setting up different camera shots, and using the green screen to interact with their creations.


### TDM99: Senior Thesis Projects
    
Jessi worked with three TDM students working on their senior thesis projects at different stages of their process. One of her biggest projects of the term was supporting a TDM senior in designing & installing her pre-show installation, particularly for the projection aspects:

Jessi also started working with seniors who filmed the first iteration of their time-capsuled process interviews, and will both work with Jessi in the spring to continue the interview process and build digital portfolios for their projects. 

## Department Support

### Time-capsuled interviews
    
Starting in Spring 2022, Jessi has been working with TDM students to reflect on their learning experiences through a time-capsuled interview format. These documentary-style student interviews prove to be a fun and effective tool for meta-cognitively crystallizing TDM learning objectives. By conducting & comparing the interviews from the beginning and end of a course, students are able to better understand the trajectory of their development.


### Projection research & support
    
This term Jessi started researching projection tools commonly used in performance spaces. Jessi & Marlon met with TDM Production Manager Andrew Gitchell to discuss how we can support student learning about projection for performance, not only to improve students' general literacy around projection, but to provide them with basic terminology and understanding that will serve their conversation with TDM production support when they embark on their senior thesis projects. 
    
We hope to host a TDM-wide "Introduction to Projection" workshop in the Spring 2023 semester, pending coordination with TDM. 
    


## Learning Lab Training


Media & Design Fellows identify key tools they need to learn in order to complete their projects. They join internal labs to receive training and practice using these tools. They also shadow experienced MDFs and Learning Lab staff as they design prompts and lead workshops. 

Jessi developed prototypes in web-based portfolio design as she learned with other MDFs about scrollytelling, a form used by publications like the New York Times. Jessi used this skill to design the TDM Time-Capsuled Interviews web-based portfolio, and will work with a TDM senior in the Spring to help them populate one of these templates with their own work. Jessi also honed her video editing skills by learning new editing methods on Final Cut Pro, including color correction and freeze-framing.
