# Kate Brehm + Learning Lab 

In partnering with Kate Brehm for her TDM90AR production studio and other courses, we are excited to offer a variety of tools, mechanics, and activities. This markdown is a running document that we will use to track ideas and proposals for new projects with Kate. Integrating media will fall into three categories:

* Media to document process & product
* Media to develop live performance
* Media within live performance

## Media to document process & product

### Time-capsuled interviews

Using documentary-style interviews, students will be given the opportunity to document changes in their learning, opinions, and goals throughout a course or project.

**Objectives include:**

* Giving students and teachers the opportunity to study why and how learning happens rather than merely evaluating the product of it
* Creating feedback loops through the experience
* Providing students with documentation to build a timeline or portfolio for their project
* Facilitating meta-cognitive articulations of shifts in learning 
* Creating edited compilations for students and teachers to easily compare and contrast changes in thinking/learning

**Logistics:**

Students can email learninglab@fas.harvard.edu 
to set up a time to film their initial interview, which will take approximately 30 minutes. They do not needs to prepare anything in advance. Students who participate in the initial interview will recieve an email at the end of the semester to  sign up for a second interview. 

Learning Lab Undergraduate Fellows will edit students' interviews in the Spring semester to deliver by the end of the school year. 

### Process documentation 

Through filming rehearsals and shows film can capture the experience of participating in the production studio over the course of the semester, tracking shifts in learning for student, the evolution of choreographic research in the classroom, and the community building.

**Logistics:**

Along with the learning lab coming in to film, students can use their smartphones to film their progress in the course and rehearsal footage, adding it to a mediapool that the learning lab can use to edit short trailors.
