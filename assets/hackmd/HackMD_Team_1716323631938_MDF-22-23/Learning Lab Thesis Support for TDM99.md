# Learning Lab Thesis Support for TDM99

At the [Bok Center for Teaching and Learning](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/home), the **[Learning Lab](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/learning-lab)** (pictured below) is  an intergenerational team and a studio space built to support creative approaches to teaching and learning.

[Jessi Stegall](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/people/jessi-stegall) is a Media & Design Fellow at the Learning Lab working with TDM courses & students to develop their media & design skills for TDM courses & assignments.

### Time-capsuled interviews

Using documentary-style interviews, students will be given the opportunity to document changes in their learning, opinions, and project development throughout the year. Much like the Vanity Fair Billie Eilish time-capsuled interviews, these interviews will be edited together to show how student thinking around the project and their artistry has evolved over time.

Students who are interested can reach out to the learning lab and book a slot to come and film their initial interview. 


### Documentation methods for iterative projects

For students that would like to use documentation methods such as film, photography, and audio recording to document their process of making & creating, you can come into the Learning Lab to experiment with different documentation techniques that they can then use in their thesis project.

### Performance prototyping
    
The Learning Lab is a great space to try out some of your ideas in miniature form, from paper prototyping set designs, experimenting with camera angles, or doing a table read of your in-process script. We have the people, materials, and space to help make that happen for you!

### Developing media for live performance

If you have an idea for including media in some final performance/presentation of your thesis, whether it be an installation, projection, or audio recording, we can help you learn the tools to create that, too!

### Video essays and podcasts
    
If you'd like to use media to create a final presentation or summary of your thesis, Jessi can teach you the skills necessary for creating a video essay or podcast to share your work through your own voice!

### Branding yourself and the work
    
Finally, Jessi can help you develop your "brand" as an artist, and generate some content & media that can be shared publicly as you prepare to enter the next stage of your creative journey. Whether it be developing an artist statement, project descriptions, or creating social media posts to share about your project, we are here to help!
