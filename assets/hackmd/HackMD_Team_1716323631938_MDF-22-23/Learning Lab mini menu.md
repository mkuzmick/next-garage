# Learning Lab mini menu 

## Who we are and how we work!

The Learning Lab is an intergenerational team and a studio space built to support creative approaches to teaching and learning. We collaborate with faculty on specific courses that are creating unconventional and multimodal assignments for their students. Media & Design Fellow in TDM Jessi Stegall is integral to all support we can provide TDM.

**Two main ways we can offer support (workshops and office hours) are described in more detail below:**

## Learning Lab Workshops
    
Working with faculty, we determine the best plan for workshops that align with the goals of the course. Our dedicated workshops offer students insight and practice with any unfamiliar skills or tools that may be beneficial for the course assignments. We can host these workshops during or outside of course time.

## Office Hours  
Students in courses the Learning Lab is supporting can drop in during our Office Hours, offered Mondays through Thursdays 3-5pm and Fridays 9am-5pm. These times are for asking technical questions and using our resources (ie. computers, software, physical materials) to work on their course project.
