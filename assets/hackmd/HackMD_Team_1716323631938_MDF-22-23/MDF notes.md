## WHAT (AND WHY) ARE THE PARTS OF THIS THING?

### presentation of visual evidence 

- first, the basic fact that it is in visual rather than textual form should be noted, and this alone makes this form a nice fit for disciplines (like Art History) that work is visual data.
- but let's take an additional step here and note with greater specificity some of the moves this piece makes with its visual data:
    - repetition of a visual trope through montage: key here is the sheer QUANTITY of visual evidence provided. In the academic writing we've analyzed--much of it written by professional art historians--we typically see 1 or 2 examples per paragraph . . . perhaps 3-5 in a paragraph truly devoted to calling out instances of a recurrent trope or form. But none of them approach the hundreds of pieces of data we encounter in this short piece. (true--there are outlying print works that make similar moves--like Goffman's _Gender Advertisements_ or Berger's _Ways of Seeing_, but one could argue that these are proto-Vox-videos, because what we see on Vox's YouTube channel seems more influenced by these works than are the pieces we see in academic journals and monographs)

### rhythm and pacing
