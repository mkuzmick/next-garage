## Notes

- How can we scaffold multimedia assignments (i.e., like a visual essay) in our courses?
    - using a notation software to compare two verses from a song
    - work on making assets ("the audio/visual bits and pieces") for the final project earlier in the term
    - close-reading of stills from music videos with annotations (could turn these into a video essay but work well as standalone things as well)
    - in discussion section - have students make micro-visual essays (some text, some media)
        - could use PowerPoint or Google Slides or Canva to prototype something like this, with callouts and circles, etc.
    - using a tool like reaper, record different spaces and then make an audio clip that combines all of those ambient sounds and have students think about the context for sounds/sounds in different environments
    - weekly video assignments where students learn to perform different processes on the computer and by the end of the term you'd have a big tutorial that students have made 
- What would students learn from the process of making an alternative form that they wouldn't learn from writing an essay alone?
    - the process of making can address the learning goals you have for students!
    - think about the analytical moves you'd want students to be able to make and how they can learn to make those moves in a new form/in some form beyond text alone
    - the point is not to do something super high-tech/technologically complex but to design activities that build toward the final assignment in an intentional way, that engage the form and what it enables in terms of academic communication
- what are your goals for yourself, as a researcher, intellectual, teacher? how could an alternative mode, form, etc. help you address those goals? what are our motivations?
    - engaging a public audience and having some kind of social, political, ethical stakes at the heart of your work
    - using the media you study to convey your research findings about that form
