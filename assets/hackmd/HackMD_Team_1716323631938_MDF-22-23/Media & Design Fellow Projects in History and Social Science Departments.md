# Media & Design Fellow Projects in History and Social Science Departments

## ArcGIS StoryMap: An Introduction to Native North America

![](https://i.imgur.com/3JCkOna.png)

History MDF Emma created a StoryMap to walk students through the political relationship of Native Americans to the United States. This StoryMap is part of a project to design supplementary course materials, including an edited video, for introducing students to the basic tenets of Native North American history. The principles undergirding the project are *reusability*, in the first instance—the StoryMap and video should be usable for different courses year-to-year—and *accessibility*—the materials are not intended to be the the last word on how to think about Native history, but rather to offer jumping off points for students to begin engaging with a field that is not often taught (or taught well) prior to the college level. 

## GENED 1044: Deep History

![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F0329E4N3A8/screen_shot_2022-02-08_at_2.47.36_pm.png?pub_secret=63cccd652d)

In Deep History, students create virtual galleries on a theme of their choosing. These galleries are populated with artifacts that tell the story of a particular theme of deep human history. In support of these final projects, MDF in History Ryan held a workshop at the Learning Lab that introduced students to a range of tools they could use to create their virtual galleries. Ryan provided students with feedback about their projects, encouraging them to think about the form of their virtual galleries and how they might most effectively display and analyze artifacts. 


## GENED 1140: Borders

MDF in History Ryan hosted a workshop and several technical tutorials for Borders, a course where students have the option of creating a video essay, podcast, or map for their final project. At the workshop, students did a close-listening of a podcast and a close-reading of a video essay, analyzing how different formal elements found in each of these media (e.g., visuals, sounds) play a particular functional role. Students then had to develop rationales for their projects and explain to the class why they intend to create a podcast or video essay given the content of their research project. At the follow-up technical workshops, students learned about the tools they can use to edit podcasts and video essays, learning the basic moves of editing in industry-standard editing tools. You can get a sense of the workshop structure by taking a look at [this website Ryan and Christine made for the course](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFR7m65WkY/VBOsFXudaajl9MM6gGXR5w/view?website#2).

Ryan also met with Professor Lewis and Belle Lipton from the Harvard Map Collection to design the GIS components of the mid-term and final projects. The goal of these meetings was to align the learning objectives related to course content and the acquisition of technical skills. In addition, we anticipated common technical difficulties and developed strategies to address them.

## Media Office Hours

Meeting with students from both Deep History and Borders, Ryan held weekly media office hours at the Learning Lab. He provided focused feedback to students as they worked on their final creative projects. These media office hours are an important way for students to get support as they work in media that might be new to them. And with the Media & Design Fellow's guidance, they can think through the affordances of the media they're using and get assistance with more technical questions as well. 

## GENED 1160: Harvard Gets Medieval Virtual Gallery Workshops

![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F03AQRR5SGJ/screen_shot_2022-04-08_at_08.38.05.png?pub_secret=3ae48752e9)

In the spring, Claire hosted students from GENED 1160: Harvard Gets Medieval for workshops and hackathons in support of students' final virtual gallery project. At the workshops, Claire introduced students to the basics of virtual galleries, providing detailed but effective tutorials in tools including Scalar, Omeka, and Canva. Claire made several example virtual galleries using these tools so that students would have models as they thought about the tools' distinct applications and capabilities. Later in the term, students were invited to come to the Learning Lab to receive further assistance and feedback on their virtual gallery projects. These hackathons provide students with a set timeframe during which they can work on their projects and receive feedback from MDFs like Claire, as well as LL staff.

## Mapping the Lives of Saints

![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F032C04NT4N/screen_shot_2022-02-10_at_10.10.11.png?pub_secret=6eb85405d5)

Over the course of two weeks during AY 2021-2022, MDF in History Claire worked with students in GENED 1160, having students make a list of locations from over 20 Saints' Lives. Claire mapped these locations in ArcGIS's online platform so that the students could then toggle the layers on and off, filter for types of saints' lives or century, and track patterns. This activity introduced students to the basics of geotagging and mapping--skills that were relevant to their final projects (in which students could, as one option, choose to make a map exemplifying a border of some kind).

## GOV 1008: Introduction to Geographic Information Systems

In support of GOV 1008: Introduction to Geographic Information Systems, MDF in Government Celia developed and facilitated a workshop in designing and displaying maps. Celia’s learning goals for this workshop included helping students learn to:
* articulate how poster design can help effectively communicate with their audience
* apply design principles to their map design within ArcGIS
* articulate what different design elements communicate to their audience in storymaps.
* create a storymap project from their ArcGIS data

The session was primarily designed to introduce the basic concepts of poster design in preparation for the course’s poster celebration at the end of the semester; and to introduce students to StoryMaps to experiment with on their own time. There was no required StoryMaps components of the course, but students were encouraged to use it to share their map work with a broader audience. Celia also discussed with students how StoryMaps can be a useful tool for helping them write their essays, as it helps them communicate the core contributions of their analysis.

## SOCIOL 1291V: Advanced Research in Reproductive Health and Rights

Instead of submitting final papers at the end of the semester, students in Reproductive Health and Justice create public-facing final projects in a variety of media. Andreja visited the course to overview a range of media that would align with students’ learning objectives and with sociological methods. Andreja led students in an activity that encouraged them to critically reflect on the sociological processes of discovery (i.e., collecting data and analyzing it) and of presentation (i.e., sharing what we have discovered in an academic paper, a podcast, a video essay, brochure or flier with infographics, etc.). In both of these processes, Andreja pointed out, students can use not only text, but also images, audio clips, short films, etc. As a Media & Design Fellow in Sociology, Andreja provides feedback to students on both fronts, helping students to craft final creative projects that intentionally deploy different media forms to share their research.
