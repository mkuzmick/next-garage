## Course Support

### GENED 1030: The Philosopher and the Tyrant Creative Projects Workshop

Students in The Philosopher and the Tyrant have the option of using different media to critically dramatize the themes of the course or to stage a dialogue between two figures studied in the course. At this workshop, students were introduced to the affordances of media forms like audio and video that would enable them to deploy genres (i.e., the televised debate) that might be especially well-suited to these final creative projects. Students were given four example creative project types to help guide their thinking: 1) a political speech by one of the authors, either through the medium of radio, television, or in a campaign ; 2) a political debate (e.g. TV presidential debate) between two or more authors ("candidates") ; 3) a political campaign ad for one of the authors or their proposed structure of government ; 4) an interview with one of the authors, either via the format of radio, podcast, or TV.

To help students understand the types of projects they could develop during their upcoming creative projects workshop, we also hosted students at the Learning Lab for a quick media session where they learned about cameras, mics, and compositing using the green screen. By having in mind the particular capacities of our space, students could begin to plan their final creative project before even attending the workshop, bringing more concrete ideas with them to the actual workshop.

### Media Office Hours for GENED 1144: Mental Health and Mental Illness Through Literature and the Arts

In support of students' final projects for Mental Health and Mental Illness Through Literature and the Arts, Min Ji hosted media office hours at the Learning Lab. These media office hours are an important way for students to get support as they work in media that might be new to them. And with the Media & Design Fellow's guidance, they can think through the affordances of the media they're using and get assistance with more technical questions as well. Min Ji advised students creating podcasts and working in audio editing tools like Adobe Audition.

### Multimedia Pedagogy for Critical Reading and Teaching/Presenting with Media Graduate Student Workshop

Media & Design Fellow in Comparative Literature Min Ji Choi developed and facilitated a session about presenting your research using digital tools. Min Ji had participants consider the media forms that make the most sense to integrate into, say, websites and other platforms given their particular research areas. 


## Learning Lab Training

Media & Design Fellows identify key tools they need to learn in order to complete their projects. They join internal labs to receive training and practice using these tools. They also shadow experienced MDFs and Learning Lab staff as they design prompts and lead workshops. 

Min Ji learned with other MDFs about scrollytelling, a form used by publications like the New York Times. Min Ji helped design and facilitate a workshop for students in interactive close-reading and visual analysis, deploying the moves of web-based interactive storytelling (i.e., isolating, re-arranging, redacting, highlighting) as they analyzed a series of texts and images. 

This working group discovered that tools like arcGIS could be useful not only for the presentation of academic/intellectual insights, but also for guiding the process of arriving at those insights.  The group started to develop a list of "intellectual moves," or ways of interacting with images and/or textual excerpts, that can guide students' analyses and syntheses of primary or secondary source materials.
