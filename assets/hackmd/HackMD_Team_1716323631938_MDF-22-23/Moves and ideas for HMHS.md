# Moves and ideas for HMHS
## visual moves
1. contrast between black and white images 
2. combine still images, graphics, and animation
3. combination of spelling key terms on the screen with saying them at the same time (visual and audio together for better comprehension)
4. a field work/ lab work/ or BTS setting 

## content moves
1. introduction definitions (3 max), then a recap
2. from definitions, move to a case study 
3. so what? why do we care? putting this info first as a way to get a hook 
4. set out a problem or question, and then think about how science can help us solve it 

## some misc comments on the examples from slack

*  there is only one voice in the entire video, which leads to no confusion about who to follow, but is also a little monotonous given the amount of info addressed 
*  higher production quality in general than the other videos- quality camera, music in the background, cuts to nice animations and images/videos
*  jam packed with information- might even be too much in such a short amount of time, no chance for the viewer to stop for a moment and process
*  information delivered in engaging and enthusiastic tone but fairly formal tone

* setting in the storage room is cool, feels like an exclusive space
* introduction and names! gives a sense of personality, connection, and authority 
* the tone is a little more casual, which i think is effective 
* NB i think this would make a good example to show the workshop, the first 1.5 minutes or so 
* giving viewers the chance to look through the scope is fun and helps the audience understand where these images and data she's talking about actually comes from

* i wish there was more variation in the setting, and the change in audio quality (when discussing the pitcher plant) lowers the quality of the video 
* i felt like some of the scientific terms he used were not always on the same level, he would explain some but not others, more consistency would make for a better product
* length is good
* it's nice that they cut to shots showing him with the plants and their native habitat- more interesting than if she just showed footage or images of the plants themselves
* good conclusion at the end
