At this workshop, Media & Design Fellow Siriana Lundgren led students and the course's professor through an exercise in score following videos. These videos show the score and play the accompanying music. During the workshop, participants analyzed some examples of the form together and then learned two tools that could help them produce score following videos of their own. The workshop also covered the basics of film editing--a useful skill for composers and musicians who want to promote their work or make and edit videos for other professional purposes.
