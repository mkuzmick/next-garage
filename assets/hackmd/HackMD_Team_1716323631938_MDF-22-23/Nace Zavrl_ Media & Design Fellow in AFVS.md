## Course Support

### AFVS 70: The Art of Film
Nace helped develop a workshop in camera work and video editing for AFVS 70. At this workshop, students were introduced to fundamental cinematic moves using the Learning Lab's camera equipment and will receive an introduction to making film montages and the basics of video editing. 

### GENED 1012: The Art and Politics of Propaganda: The Nazis and Their Legacy
Nace organized and conducted a workshop on the theory and practice of the moving image essay for students and teaching staff of GENED 1012. Students were introduced to the essential technical, conceptual, as well as ethical aspect of video essays as a medium and argumentative genre. The workshop equipped students in GENED 1012 with the tools necessary to develop their own audiovisual essay as a final assignment in the class.

### GENED 1072: Video Commune
Nace assisted with the design and technical scaffolding for Karthik Pandian's GENED, taught for the first in spring 2023. As a hybrid theory/production course (with an anticipated enrollment of 60), GENED 1072 offered a number of challenges and questions as to how video content could be delivered to students, as well as how students could be able to interact with it and upload their own material. Nace organized a system of handling these challenges through a combination of online platforms and in-person pedagogical strategies.

### AFVS 205: Graduate Seminar in Curricular Development
Nace worked with Laura Frahm, Haden Guest, and the members of AFVS 205 on brainstorming and putting together a roadmap for potential future changes in the syllabus of AFVS 70: The Art of Film, an introductory gateway class for undergraduates. Among topics discussed were the role of videomaking and creative assignments in an introductory film class, issues around incorporating practical workshops into a primarily lecture-centered course, and the role of a Media & Design Fellow in the educational process.

## Department Support

### Prior Term Enrollment

Nace researched the systems and protocols of previous-semester enrollment at peer institutions in order to come up with a set of best practices that works for the specificities of a media and art department (AFVS). 

### AFVS Alumni Database
Nace helped with design and data entry on an alumni database that can be used by undergraduates in AFVS. This database helps undergraduate concentrators connect with folks who already graduated from the department and work in relevant/interesting fields. This is an important professional development tool for concentrators.
