## Event
Location: Learning Lab Main Studio
Time: Wednesday, March 8,  6:00pm - 7:15pm
Number of students: 10

## Purpose
This is a workshop helping students to apply scientific communication skills they have been working on throughout the school year towards creating academic posters. This skill will help students create quality posters to submit to an upcoming conference.

## Room and Tech Layout
* Several computers at each bench with PowerPoint/Keynote, Adobe Illustrator
* One computer with the ability to project to screens so students can share their work at the end of the session
* Large pieces of paper, cards, and drawing supplies on each bench
* Print outs of the example posters to put at the different work benches


## Outline of Workshop
* Emily leads discussion on the poster as a form of scicomm, especially noting the ways in which posters communicate science differently than PowerPoint slides (5 min)
    * use example posters to help inspire ideas (focus on one or two to unpack)
* Students spend time considering the macrostructure and interrelationships within the research story of their poster (10-15 min)
    * write/draw out the written  components of their science story on cards 
    * lay the cards on top of a large sheet of paper and draw arrows between components that are related to each other 
    * rearrange and resize components to be in a logical and effective arrangment
    * think about where written components can be made graphical
* Students think about how they would edit the digital drafts of their posters (30 min)
* Groups share the "before and after" versions of their poster and explain why they made the changes they chose (15 min)
    * Get practice presenting- we didn't have time to get to this portion of the workshop

## Reflections
This workshop was a great opportunity for students to consider the ways in which creating successful poster presentations is similar and different from the oral presentations they were working on earlier in the semester.  We discussed how careful layout is key for the audience to know how to read the material on the poster and understand how different components of that material are related to one another. Students generally also considered ways in which words could be trimmed or replaced with visuals to make their posters easier to read and more aesthetically pleasing.

## Media
* computers with Powerpoint, Illustrator, and Keynote open
* art supplies on the tables
