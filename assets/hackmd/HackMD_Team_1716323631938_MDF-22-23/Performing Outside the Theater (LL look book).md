# Performing Outside the Theater (LL look book)
TDM 172B Tania Bruguera

*Artists can de-naturalize things that were always there. They can transform a modest action into an unforgettable experience. Discreet performances can liberate forgotten feelings.  But, are we trained to ¨see¨ outside the theater? Could a bench on a park be the perfect place to experience a dramatic plot? Would your kitchen table be the best set for a scene? In this class we are going to experience the displacement of theatrical constructions. We are taking the ¨frame¨ of theater and situate it in diverse environments and situations (from your living room to the street to a phone call to a post on social media). We’ll experiment with duration (from a minute performance to a semester long performance) to understand the potential of our scripts.*

## About the Learning Lab 

The Bok Center’s Learning Lab is an intergenerational team and a studio space built to support creative approaches to teaching and learning. We typically work with undergraduate courses through a workshop model - we collaborate with faculty to devise tailored workshops that teach students any unfamiliar skills or tools that may be beneficial for course assignments & learning objectives. Below are a number of ways could support your course!

##  Prototyping

### Physical materials prototyping

The Learning Lab studio is equipped to support miniature prototyping, using paper and other materials to create table-top miniature environments. We can then use our video layer system to interactively explore performances within these miniature spaces.

## Documentation  
    
### Process capture
   
We work with courses to develop methods for capturing the processes of creation, either by us, or by the students as "acts of self-documentation" including but not limited to:
    
* audio capture
* video capture
* capture protocols
    - repeting methods 
    - isolation of details
    - slices of time
    - perspectives

### Process display
    
After capturing elements of the creation process, we can support students in displaying their process through low-stakes but large-scale opportunities to repeat key moves of reflection, analysis, and critical thinking, including:
    
* social-media posts with micro-reflections
* digital portfolios
* show-and-tells using our live green screen and video-layer work to interact with documentation
* web-based essays 
* mini-installations

## Additional tools    
    
### Tablescapes
    
The tablescape tool pairs "table as stage" with ATEM software to create brief table performance, using your hands, props, information cards, and multiple camera angles. These are incredibly effective communication tools to deliver multiple layers of information at once in a polished, recorded presentation.

### Meta-cognitive reflective interviews
    
We have found documentary-style student interviews to be a fun and effective tool for meta-cognitively crystallizing learning objectives and encouraging students to reflect on their goals, progress, and learning in the course. By comparing beginning and end of semester interviews, students are able to better understand the trajectory of their development.
