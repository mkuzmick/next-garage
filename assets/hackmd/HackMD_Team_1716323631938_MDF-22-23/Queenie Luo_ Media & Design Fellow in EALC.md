**Project Title:** Optimizing the GENED 1091 Course Website for Improved Student Engagement and Learning

**Project Duration:** Fall 2022

## Summary:

This project aimed to enhance the learning experience of students taking the GENED 1091 course. The enhancement revolved around optimizing the course website with a focus on showcasing students' final creative projects. Additionally, it involved the creation of a course roadmap syllabus, hosting office hours for project consultation, developing individual student webpages, and assisting in strategizing course methodologies to boost student motivation and inspiration.

## Project Description:

The project undertook the following key tasks:

1. **Creation of a Students' Final Creative Projects View:** A dedicated view was established on the course website to display the final creative projects of students. This feature facilitates a two-fold benefit. It allows current students to draw inspiration from the work of their predecessors, broadening their perspective on the spectrum of creative possibilities. Furthermore, it provides a platform for future students to refer back to their work and engage in metacognitive reflection, an exercise made possible due to the reflective write-ups requested from each student upon project completion.

2. **Course Roadmap Syllabus:** A comprehensive course roadmap was developed to provide a clear and concise overview of the course's trajectory. This roadmap acts as a guide, assisting students in understanding the course's structure, expectations, and key milestones.

3. **Office Hours for Project Consultation:** Regular office hours were held to provide students with the opportunity to discuss and receive feedback on their final creative projects. This interaction fostered a more personalized learning experience and facilitated better project outcomes.

4. **Individual Student Webpages:** Custom webpages were created for each student to host their creative projects. This feature not only personalizes the course experience but also provides a platform for students to showcase their work beyond the duration of the course.

5. **Course Strategy Assistance:** Collaborated with Professor Michael Puett to devise strategies aimed at motivating and inspiring students in their creative project endeavors. These strategies were integrated into the course delivery to foster a more engaging and motivating learning environment.

**Project Title:** Creating Interactive Timelines for EASTD 97AB: Introduction to the Study of East Asia: Issues and Methods

**Project Duration:** Spring 2023

## Summary:

The project consisted of designing and creating three distinct timelines to be incorporated into the EASTD 97AB course curriculum. Each timeline offers a unique perspective on the history of East Asia, aiding the students' understanding by providing varying levels of detail and different foci. The timelines were hosted online and integrated with rich multimedia content including images, videos, and interactive geographical maps.

## Project Description:

The three timelines created were as follows:

1. A comprehensive timeline viewable at [Historical Events Timeline](https://china-timeline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/index.html). This timeline was designed to incorporate an expansive amount of information. It includes key historical events, significant figures, and their biographies. It was further enriched with the integration of relevant images and videos. This timeline serves as an in-depth resource for students to gain a thorough understanding of East Asia's extensive history.

2. A geographical timeline viewable at [China's Geographical Changes Timeline](https://eastd97.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/china3.htm). This timeline was specifically designed to showcase the evolution of China's geographical boundaries over time. It challenges the common misconception that China's geographical area has been consistent throughout history. This timeline aims to provide a dynamic perspective on how geopolitical changes have shaped China's current form.

3. A comparative timeline viewable at [Comparative Timeline](https://eastd97.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/comparative.html). This timeline provides a high-level overview of the historical backgrounds of China, Japan, and other major civilizations in East Asia. It is comparatively simpler and provides a clear, visual comparison of the concurrent developments in these civilizations.

# <font color='crimson'>3. CS32: Computational Thinking and Problem Solving Course Website</font>

**Project Title:** Designing and Creating an Interactive Course Website for CS32

**Project Duration:** Spring 2023

## Executive Summary:

The project aimed at enhancing the educational experience for CS32: Computational Thinking and Problem Solving course students by developing a comprehensive, user-friendly course website. The website was designed to host course materials, illustrate complex concepts, and provide a clear course roadmap to guide students throughout their learning journey.

## Project Description:

The project involved several key components:

1. **Course Website Creation:** A website was created as a centralized platform to host CS32 course materials. However, the current website is still under construction. The goal of this website is to help students to quickly get a high-level overview of course material and help them to decide whether this is a good course for them or not. 

2. **Content Illustration:** To facilitate a deeper understanding of complex computational concepts, I helped Professor Mike Smith to create visual illustrations. These illustrations were designed to represent abstract ideas in a more tangible and relatable format, aiding students in grasping and retaining complex information.

3. **Course Roadmap:** A detailed course roadmap is going to be create to help students get a high level overview of the course content. The roadmap will highlight key milestones, concepts, and assignments, acting as a guide for students to manage their time and expectations effectively throughout the course.
