# Ria Gyawali: Bok Media & Design Fellow

## Course Support

### ANTHRO 1813 Graphic Design Workshop

Ria developed a graphic design workshop for ANTHRO 1813: Science from the Arctic: Histories and Futures. In this course, students create final reports that incorporate images, infographics, and text to convey key data to community-based organizations. These reports contain very complex and sensitive content that needs to be condensed and organized in thoughtful ways. Students learned about the importance of intentionally designed layout and the graphic design principles that can help them design effective layouts. They also chose key portions of their reports to visualize, using arts supplies to make visual representations of their texts. 

### ANTHRO1610: Ethnographic Research Methods Sonic Ethnography Workshop

Ria developed a sonic ethnography workshop for ANTHRO1610: Ethnographic Research Methods. Ria had students analyze ethnographic recordings before going out onto Harvard's campus to record their own. She also taught them how to use Zoom recorders, which are common recording devices used for ethnographic fieldwork. Ria also consulted with students about their final projects, providing them with individualized feedback that considered both the course's content and the media form (sound) that students were using to analyze anthropological data.

### ANTHRO1822: Environment, Health, and Justice Final Project Support

Ria consulted with students about their final projects, providing them with individualized feedback that could address both course content and the media forms the students were using in their final projects.

### GENED 1049: East Asian Cinema

This workshop introduced students to the basics of shot composition, blocking, and lighting using films as the course as models. At three different stations, students had the chance to recreate scenes from these films. One station introduced students to three-point lighting and hard versus soft lighting techniques. Another station taught students about shot-reverse-shot and a third station taught students about camera movement.

## Learning Lab Training

Media & Design Fellows identify key tools they need to learn in order to complete their projects. They join internal labs to receive training and practice using these tools. They also shadow experienced MDFs and Learning Lab staff as they design prompts and lead workshops. 

Ria docked with audio/visual lab and learned about cameras and microphones, including best practices for a/v capture in a studio environment.
