## Course Support

### GENED 1044: Deep History

In Deep History, students create virtual galleries on a theme of their choosing. These galleries are populated with artifacts that tell the story of a particular theme of deep human history. In support of these final projects, Ryan held a workshop at the Learning Lab that introduced students to a range of tools they could use to create their virtual galleries. Ryan provided students with feedback about their projects, encouraging them to think about the form of their virtual galleries and how they might most effectively display and analyze artifacts. 


### GENED 1140: Borders

Ryan hosted a workshop and several technical tutorials for Borders, a course where students have the option of creating a video essay, podcast, or map for their final project. At the workshop, students did a close-listening of a podcast and a close-reading of a video essay, analyzing how different formal elements found in each of these media (e.g., visuals, sounds) play a particular functional role. Students then had to develop rationales for their projects and explain to the class why they intend to create a podcast or video essay given the content of their research project. At the follow-up technical workshops, students learned about the tools they can use to edit podcasts and video essays, learning the basic moves of editing in industry-standard editing tools.

Ryan also met with Professor Lewis and Belle Lipton from the Harvard Map Collection to design the GIS components of the mid-term and final projects. The goal of these meetings was to align the learning objectives related to course content and the acquisition of technical skills. In addition, we anticipated common technical difficulties and developed strategies to address them.

### Media Office Hours

Meeting with students from both Deep History and Borders, Ryan held weekly media office hours at the Learning Lab. He provided focused feedback to students as they worked on their final creative projects. These media office hours are an important way for students to get support as they work in media that might be new to them. And with the Media & Design Fellow's guidance, they can think through the affordances of the media they're using and get assistance with more technical questions as well.
