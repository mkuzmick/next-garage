# S307B Smartphone Video Basics Workshop - Student Resource Guide
Filming a video from just a smartphone isn't complicated, but there are a few things you will want to keep in mind. Think of what you will want to control before, during, and after filming. 

Before filming, consider:
- **Your phone settings**: use the highest definition possible (like 4k), and 24 fps.
- **Sound**: Using your phone's built-in microphone is fine, but experiment with connecting headphones or [borrowing an external microphone](https://library.harvard.edu/spaces?room=161&room_type=481). Then, control the environment. Dampen echos in the room you're in (even spreading blankets across floors and tables will help), and avoid filming near things like air vents or refridgerators if indoors, or wind if outdoors. For voiceovers, make sure to recreate the setting you record in each time if you record in multiple sessions. 

During filming, consider:
- **Orientation**: Be consistent with the orientation you hold your phone. For our purposes, filming horizontally throughout is best.
- **Types of footage**: Think about interviews, still photos, and footage of the building or physical location where your event takes place. Be sure to capture behind the scenes footage. This can be an incredible resource when it comes to illustrating the who, what, when, where, and how of your project. 
- **Experimenting**: What happens to your footage when you walk as you record, or hold your phone at a different angle? If you're filming an interview, how do different environments affect the feel of the conversation?  Does your phone allow you to shoot in timelapse or slow motion? Spend a few minutes playing around with capturing video and see what happens.

After filming, consider:
- **Sharing and storing video**: When transfering footage between you and your project partners, the way you share matters. Texting will often compress videos, but using Google Drive, WeTransfer, WeChat, or WhatsApp will allow you to send videos in the original quality. 
- **Labeling**: Your footage will add up fast. Deciding on a system in advance will save time now and in the future. Consider renaming all files to include things like the date, time, and location of filming.
- **Editing**: Some phones will allow you to make micro edits directly from the device, which can be helpful. The end of this document lists tutorials for various types of editing software.
