# Sarah Hazelwood: Media & Design Fellow in HGSE

## Course Support

### EDU S307A: Creating Community and Cultural Life Through Arts Learning

In support of EDU S307A, Sarah worked with students to support their ideas, assist them with planning, and help them complete their projects. Sarah has met with the students during class, as well as one-on-one, researching tools and procedures (such as researching two-party consent laws in MA for podcast recordings, and more technical support like troubleshooting audio quality problems in recordings, etc.). Sarah has learned tools including Final Cut Pro, GarageBand, visual novel engines, etc. And she has worked on documenting student work, in the form of photos, videos, gifts, interviews, during and outside of class.

A core component of Sarah's work includes helping the course with documentation planning: planning documentation procedures for spring semester for in-class and out-of-class activities and projects and developing a documentation archival system.

Sarah also provides support to the course team, attending weekly teaching team meetings, contributing to planning as details take shape, including structure of course, assignments, readings, events, course intentions and objectives. Sarah also designed mechanisms for mid-semester feedback from students enrolled in the course. To this end, Sarah created a feedback form, collected feedback responses, and shared response data with the teaching team.

Throughout the term, Sarah has also hosted drop-in studio hours at the Learning Lab, providing students with feedback on their specific projects.
