# Score Follower Workshop

Film editing is an improtnat skills for composers to learn as they build promotional material for their works and as they seek to push the mediums through which they can design music. In this workshop, we aim to equip composers at the undergraduate (and some at the graduate level) with basic knowledge of free film editing programs over the course of an hour.

**Advertising Paragraph** Do you want to learn how to create a follow along video of your musical score? We’ll be exploring Adobe Premiere and the software Scorefollower in an hour long workshop where we’ll focus on rhythmic film editing. Come to learn the basics of film editing for composers.

Guiding Questions:
* What about this animation is succesful? 
* What does it illustrate in the music? What does it miss? 
* What does the animation show you that you might have otherwise missed? 
* Why might you want a similar video for your own composition?
* Who is the audience for this or any score-following video?

## Score Follower
Score follower is a software that automatically maps an imported PDF and WAV file of your composition together into one moving graphic, so you can seamlessly put together a simple score following video without needing video editing skills.
