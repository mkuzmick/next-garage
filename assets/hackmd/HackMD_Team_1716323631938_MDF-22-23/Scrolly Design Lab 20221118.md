# Scrolly Design Lab 20221118
## goals
Here is the challenge from the document:
Each lab should come up with an activity that they’d like to test out in designLab to get feedback from the Learning Lab Undergraduate Fellows and staff! Some questions that might help you as you come up with an activity:

What are your learning goals for your activity?
What analytical “moves” do you want students to learn/make during the activity?
What framing can you provide at the outset that will help students understand:
what they are doing?
why they are doing it?
What will students do during this activity? Describe any stations you might like to have.
come up with as many ideas as possible!!!

## Notes
There is a lot that is left behind in the process of crafting an essay. What can't you usually display in writing? This DesignLab will give pariticipants an opportunity to identify different moves you can make with scrollytelling, including close observation, iteraction, redaction, etc. The learning objective is to demistify not only scrollytelling as a form, but analysis as an academic skill. 

General workshop structure: LLUFs will be split into **3 groups** and each given an **image and accompanying text**. They will travel through 3 different stations that give them a taste of different scrollytelling moves.  

## Introduction: What is scrollytelling

* (MDF and/or Marlon) will introduce Scrollytelling as a form, give some examples, introduce storymaps, talk about learning objectives, and provide an overview what they will be doing during the DesignLab. 

## Steps?
1) do something with the material (image, text, etc)
    - a group would get a packet of material related to topic or discipline
    - each person pulls a verb/scrolly move and then do that with something from that packet
    - ex: I pull "redact" and then do the transparency redaction 
    - we want to make sure the moves map one-to-one onto moves they can do on storymaps
    - make material pools ahead of time
2) how do you show us these moves you've made on storymaps 
3) share!

* led by Anna? 

### Cutting, Pasting, Collage

* led by (MDF)

### Image and Text (?)
- Carly
(using different versions of ekphrastic poems on Brueghel's Hunters in the Snow - asking each group member to mark up their image based on one of those versions?)
    
## Outline of activity
    
### First ~ 30 minutes

5-10: Intro: give examples; give directions; hand out packets and materials
8-10: Students looking through materials as a group
8-10: dividing up items, working independently (working w/ both visual material; thinking about what they might want to say in sidecar annotations - maybe using colored notecards for bulleted notes?)
	each of us available to help / answer group’s questions

### Next ~ 30-45 minutes

10 min: helping students capture images of their work (either on their / our phones and send to Scrollab slack or airdrop to one MDF; use overhead if needed)
5: orientation to putting images in StoryMaps
~15-20: students putting images into StoryMaps

### Last ~ 15 minutes

At least one group volunteer to present? Then general discussion about what students noticed / what worked, what didn’t


## Reflections 
    - might be useful to set up an overhead camera to take consistent images of the same size for inserting into StoryMaps
    - make sure to emphasize // scaffold narrating the scrolly 'moves'
        - more explicit description of how these analysis moves relate to essay-writing skills
    - make a handout that outlines the tasks students will do at their tables
    - pre- or post-lab assignments to effectively incorporate into their learning in the course
