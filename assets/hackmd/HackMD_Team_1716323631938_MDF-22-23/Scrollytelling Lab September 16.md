# Scrollytelling Lab September 16

### Concrete steps for learning and designing initial learning project:
- Review material, examples for scrollytelling: platforms and softwares
    

### Prompt for an initial learning activity:
- Lookbook in HackMD where each person brings a different program to explore, providing benefits and drawbacks
- Break down examples of scrollytelling. What are the moves, what are the parts, what are the elements? 
    - Using one program/platform, try to re-engineer an existing essay into a minimal scrollytelling essay and share notes on how that worked? 
    - Idea for "experiment," maybe in DesignLab?: give the same essay to students/participants in a few different formats and see how their takeaways and experiences differ
