# Second 189vg Workshop planning 



## Mini-Presentation Challenge

*The final project asks students to give a 10 minute, 5-6 slide oral presentation on a game **not** on the syllabus, one that mounts an argument for why that game should be considered an innovative piece of storytelling. A broader premise of the presentation project is that games students argue for might be included as part of future iterations of the course syllabus.*

To help students prepare for their presentations, we will be running 4 1 hr and 15 minute workshops with the end goal of having students--in groups of three--produce mini-presentations (5 minutes, 3 slides). The workshop will be broken into three parts or phases:

### 1. Orientation to visual design & tools for presentations (focusing on using Canva) [15 minutes; in classroom]
### 2. Presentation development [45-50 min; in studio]
- students in groups of three; each with a computer ready with a shared Canva document
- start by having groups discuss the games they've chosen / are considering using for their final presentation [10 min]
    - include short worksheet for students to fill out identifying key elements of their chosen games
    #### **Main Task**
    - Create a 3 slide presentation that offers a coherent account of what a new unit on the syllabus might look like if it included these games. {See structure from ... book.}
    - Presentations will be constrained in two ways:
        - Students will randomly select three lenses (developed from Schell) from a deck of cards, which they should use as frames for thinking about their games (up to two cards may be returned and redrawn once; cards can also be traded with other groups)
        - Students will choose three key terms from a wall of terms, drawn from course handouts on the course Canvas page; once one group chooses a term, that term is unavailable to other groups, unless traded.
### 3. Presentation [10-15min]
- two to three groups volunteer to present

#### Lens of Essential Experience

- Don't think about *the game*; think about *the experience of the player*

- What questions does the game put into the player's mind?
- What does the game do to make them care about these questions?

#### Lens of Endogenous value

- Endogenous: "caused by factors inside the organism or system"; "internally generated"
- Endogenous value = things that have value *only* inside the game (e.g., monoploy money)
- The more compelling a game is, the greater the endogenous value that is created in the game

- What are the problems players have to solve to succeed in this game?
- Are there hidden problems that arise as part of gameplay
- How does the game generate new problems so that player's keep coming back.

#### Lens of Functional Space
- What is the space in which the game really takes place, when all the surface elements are stripped away?
- Is the space discrete or continuous?
- How many dimensions does it have?
- What are the boundaries of the space
- Are there sub-spaces? How are they connected?
- How would you abstractly model the space of this game? How might you diagram it on a single slide?

#### Lens of Goals
- What is the ultimate goal of the game?
- Is the goal clear to players?
- Is there a seires of goals? How are those goals related? Are they meaningfully related?
- Are the goals concrete, achievable, and rewarding
- How are short- and long-term goals balanced?
- Can players decide on their own goals?

#### Lens of Skill
- What skills does the game require from the player?
- Are they interesting and rewarding skills? 
- Which skills are dominant? Are any missing?
- How do the skills relate to the broader experience of the game?
- Is the level of skill right?

#### Lens of Chance
- What in the game is random? What feel random?
- What kinds of feelings does randomness provoke in the game? (Challenge? Excitement?)
- What risks can players take in the game? Are they interesting?
- What is the relationship between chance and skill in the game?

#### Lens of Choice
- What choices does the game ask the player to make?
- Are those choices meaningful? How and why?
- How would the game be different if the player were given more, fewer, or different kinds of choices?

#### Lens of Progress
- What does it mean to make progress in the game?
- How is progress made visible? 

#### Lens of Physical Interface
- What does the player pick up and touch? What does this feel like?
- How does this map to the actions in the game world?
- How does the player see, hear, and touch the world of the game? What makes the game real in the player's imagination?

#### Lens of Interest
- What aspects of the game capture the interest of the player immediately?
- What does the game let the player see or do that they have never seen before?

#### Lens of Obstacle
- What is the relationship between the main character and the goal? Why does the character care about it?
- What are the obstacles between the character and the goal?
- Is there an antagonist? What is the relationship between the protagonist and antagonist?
- How big are the obstacles?
- Does the protagonist transform? If so, how so? If not, why not?

#### Lens of Freedom
- When do players have freedom of action? When do they feel free?
- When are they constrained? How do they feel constrained?
- What is the balance of freedom and constraint?
