## Course Support

### ANTHRO 1826: Advanced Topics in Medical Anthropology: Paul Farmerâ€™s Contributions to Medical Anthropology and Global Health

To prepare for their podcast assignment, students came to the Learning Lab to learn about the form of podcasts and the steps one would need to take in order to make one that is intentionally designed. After analytically unpacking a podcast--discussing the different functions of each audio component--students were introduced to the fundamentals of audio editing.

Media & Design Fellows identify key tools they need to learn in order to complete their projects. They join internal labs to receive training and practice using these tools. They also shadow experienced MDFs and Learning Lab staff as they design prompts and lead workshops. 

Shanni developed prototypes and workshops in web-based interactive essays as she learned with other MDFs about scrollytelling, a form used by publications like the New York Times. Shanni researched tools that could be used to help students perform the key moves of interactive close-reading and visual analysis.

This working group discovered that tools like arcGIS could be useful not only for the presentation of academic/intellectual insights, but also for guiding the process of arriving at those insights.  The group started to develop a list of "intellectual moves," or ways of interacting with images and/or textual excerpts, that can guide students' analyses and syntheses of primary or secondary source materials.
