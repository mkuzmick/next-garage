# Slavic 132 Scrollytelling Workshop

- Students from Slavic 132 (Russia's "Golden Age") came to the Learning Lab (or in the case of one section, met in the Barker Center) about a scrollytelling project. They were given physical materials (excerpts of texts, images, etc) related to Gogol's *Dead Souls* and asked to mark them up and layer them. 

## Workshop summary
### Introduction
We began with an introduction: what is scrollytelling? Who has heard of it? Do they have any associations with it? What are the moves and elements that make up scrollytelling? How can we unpack a model? What are the ethical dimensions of scrollytelling? We used these slides:

### Work time
Then, they went to tables with materials and were assigned to create layered stories, using the overhead transparencies or other layering techniques. They had about 20-30 minutes, and created some really wonderful materials:

### ArcGIS
Then, I gave a tutorial on using ArcGIS StoryMaps, creating demo StoryMaps with the students using the materials they'd created:


### Wrapping up


### After the workshop
Students were put into groups to create a StoryMap based on Tolstoy's *Hadji Murat*, which you can see here:
