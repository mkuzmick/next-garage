# Slavic 132: Instructions for Scrollytelling

### What is scrollytelling? Why scrollytelling?
*scrollytelling*: variously defined, but easy to know when you see it

some of these definitions or descriptions:
* when content (e.g., a graphic) is revealed or changed as the user scrolls.
* Also called Narrative Visualisation, it consists of creating a logical sequence of related (data-driven) visualisations, or visual elements, needed to convey a message to an audience in an engaging and effective way.

[An example from the NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/06/books/auden-musee-des-beaux-arts.html), which publishes in this form frequently.


**Why scrollytelling?**
-It allows for a dynamic, not static, engagement with text (broadly defined)


### What are we asking you to do?
Using ArcGIS StoryMaps, you'll be tasked with creating a scrollytelling story related to some aspect of *Hadji Murat*. Your goal is to combine various materials and media to create a compelling story and guide us through your work. 

Scrollytelling is all about telling compelling stories, so really think about the moves that you're making! How are you guiding your reader? What aspects of the text, context, or other material are you highlighting? How  are you comparing, juxtaposing, contrasting, zooming in and out on your material? How are you using the affordances of the platform to emphasize the points you want to make? What are you doing here that you can't do in an essay about *Hadji Murat*? How are you using the dynamism to guide us through the material?

You should aim to use at least 2-3 different types of material (but more would be great!), including, but not limited to:
- text (from *Hadji Murat* or otherwise)
- your own writing!
- images (photos, paintings, etc)
- maps (that you create in ArcGIS or images of maps)
- timelines 
- infographics or other data visualizations

You don't want to just present item after item, though: in this assignment, aim to make 2-3 moves that guide your reader, tell your story, and work with the dynamism possible in scrollytelling:
      Examples:

      - Here, you see annotation of images, juxtaposition of two images, and the use of the sidecar in ArcGIS to combine each part of this with some (very basic) analysis




Remember, anything you can take an image of, you can upload into a StoryMap! So, for example, if you want to redact, highlight, annotate a text, you can take a photo of that and upload it.

### So, how do you do this?

First, you'll need an ArcGIS account, which you are given through Harvard. Sign in [here](https://harvard-cga.maps.arcgis.com/home/index.html)

Then, you'll need to join our group. You can request to join it [here](https://harvard-cga.maps.arcgis.com/home/group.html?id=1d8b69954ba0478fb7da924ce5eb4457#overview). 

Then, you and your groupmates will create a collaborative storymap. 

You can add media by adding content blocks. Mousing over each block will tell you about the type of content it contains, but if you have questions, you can refer to the tutorial or ask Anna!

How to use ArcGIS StoryMaps:
- You will be given a tutorial at the Scrollytelling workshop (March 20 and 21 in the Learning Lab), but you can also start [here](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/cea22a609a1d4cccb8d54c650b595bc4) to see the ArcGIS website's tutorial if you need refreshers.
