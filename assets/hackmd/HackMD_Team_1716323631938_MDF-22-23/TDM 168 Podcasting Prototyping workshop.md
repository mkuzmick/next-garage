# TDM 168 Podcasting Prototyping workshop

## Course
**TDM172:** Podcast: Uploading the Present (Mon 9-11:45AM)
**Instructor:** Tania Brugera
**Teaching Fellow:** Alex from the ART?

**Course description:** *The Podcast is a popular alternative to traditional media. Expanding from news to entertainment it influences contemporary culture and our vision of the present. During the semester we will explore different subjects of interest to create the identity of a Podcast that we will produce in the class. After experiencing various approaches to this medium, we will decide the genre in which the podcast will be produced (interview, narrative, entertainment, news, educational, debate, confessional, fiction, investigative journalism, etc.). The final assignment is the recording of an episode that will be of interest to the community on campus.*
