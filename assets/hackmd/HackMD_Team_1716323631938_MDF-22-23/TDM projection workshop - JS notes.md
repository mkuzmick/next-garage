# TDM projection workshop - JS notes

## Introduction

Why use projection in performance? (ask them)
    - simulate a particular location or time period
    - create a partciular atmosphere
    - special effects
    - layering visuals
    - simply converying information 
    
    
Lets take a look at some examples of projection in performance from recent professional productions and see what kind of moves they are making here

- the orchard (anyone want to take a stab at how this is being constructed?)
- einsteins dreams 
- dear evan hansen
- west side story


## Input

* pre-recorded media (how do we get it on the projector?)
* live-feed (how do we get this on the projectors and how is it different than pre-recorded media?)


## Projector capacities
* ports - VGA, HDMI, USB, mini displayport, maybe even mirrordisplay?
* throw distance is the distance between the projector and the image on the screen
    * Long Throw: Providing very large images, this type of throw is usually from projectors that are installed in the center of the ceiling in a large room.
    * Short Throw: Providing large images while reducing shadows and eye glare, this type of throw is usually seen from projectors either installed on the wall or the ceiling closer to the wall â€” anywhere that is close to where the image will be projected. Short-throw projection generally refers to a distance between 3 to 8 feet away from projector to screen.
    * Ultra-Short Throw: Virtually eliminates shadows and eye glare, this type of throw is seen from projectors installed on the wall, the ceiling nearer to a wall, or a table projecting downwards. Ultra-short throw projection refers to a distance between 0 to 4 feet away from projector to screen.

* contrast ratio is the difference between light and dark on a screen expressed by a number. If you take the brightest white on a screen and the darkest black and compare the luminosity, you will get the contrast ratio. High contrast is great for projections to get a clear picture. 

* most improtant thing is BRIGHTNESS (measured in 'lumens') - the brighter the better

## Surfaces

* Imagine farkas - can it be a screen?
* walls to cielings to curtains to bedsheets to professional-grade material from Rosebrand
* light-colored and reflective surfaces work best
