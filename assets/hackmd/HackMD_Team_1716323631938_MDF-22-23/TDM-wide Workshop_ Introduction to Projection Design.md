# TDM-wide Workshop: Introduction to Projection Design

*Optional Workshop*

**Workshop Description:** *The Learning Lab invites Theater, Dance & Media students to join them for a 2-hour workshop on the basic elements of using projection in live performance. Students will be invited to experiment with using different kinds of projectors on various materials and irregular objects, as well as exploring ways of incorporating projection into their performances.*

## Event

**Location:** Learning lab Main Studio
**Time:** Tuesday 2/21 (6:30-8:30PM)
**Number:** 8 [sign ups here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RY-J7taZwO2tmFRctjj2oBg06ZfPmZE702Jojkw5IdI/edit?usp=sharing)

## Purpose

This workshop aims to introduce TDM students to the basic elements of using projection in live performance. We hope that by developing their literacy around projection, this workshop will help streamline conversations had with TDM production staff when students include projections in their senior thesis projects.

## Room and Tech Layout
* computer at main bench, keyed onto green paper on tablescape
* Mini projection sequence on main table:
    * 3 Mini projectors on tripods, each with ipad and macbook with isadora
    * surfaces (reflective, absorbant, dark, light)
    * stage area (take down rainbow, set up white to drop down)
    * overhead camera between trusses on stage
    * longer cable to roll projector
    * maybe 2nd camera feed to toggle between?
    * 
* green screen lit with stable camera in front

## Workshop Outline

### Welcome & Eat (10 min)
- gathering in the space and making a plate
### Introduction (15 min) - JS

* Introduction to Learning Lab 
* Introduction to projection in performance
    * Why might someone want to use projection in a live theatre performance? (ask them)
        * simulate particular location or time period
        * to create a partciular atmosphere
        * special effects
        * layering visuals
* Examples of how projection is being used in recent theatre productions
    * [The Orchard (2022)](https://slack-files.com/T0HTW3H0V-F04P8V1MK9P-9c5adad969)
    * [Einsteins Dreams (2019)](https://slack-files.com/T0HTW3H0V-F04P903AKLZ-9c067a5264)

### Walk-through projection sequence (45 min) - JS & CC
(using minis)

#### input (what is going into the projector)
- can be pre-recorded media

@casey what do we want this to be? maybe pull some cool greenscreen footage we have? And some visual effects from online?


- can be live feed

> In pairs or groups of 3, each given mini projector connected to live ipad feed
 
- through isadora (Casey gives brief introduction on isadora, including bringing in media, adding effects, masking, color correction) 

> In pairs or groups of 3, each given mini projector connected to isadora, choose a piece of media and create a 3-scene timeline using masking & effects

#### projector capacities
- different projectors have different ports 
- throw distance
- image size
- contrast ratio
- brightness

#### surfaces 
   - show a underexposed image on dark surface, light surface, transparent surface 
- give some rules of thumb for projecting light on different surfaces
    - @Casey  - can you help me expand on this?

#### extra tips
* avoid stage lighting from pointing directly at your screen
* keep projector high and tilt them down to keep actor's shadows off the screen (this is achieved with a kind of lasor projector that has a 'keystone' setting that TDM has but the LL doesn't). also consider a short-throw or a rear-projection. 



### Projection-in-Performance Zones (30-40 min)

Maybe each person or pair cycling through some different zones to communally try to recreate our own version of some of the examples we can provide above?

**Moves** (see examples in introduction)
- projecting live feed from a perspective we can't get as an audience onto a transparent (or translusent) screen (The Orchard)
- projecting live feed from a perspective we can see, blowing it up big and masking out the actual performance (can we do this on a smaller scale? (west side story)
- creatting multiple surfaces on the stage and making the images appear in different places using isadora (dear evan hansen)
- Projecting ambiguous visuals at different points in space (einsteins dreams)

**Zones:**

- Stages (1-2)
- Green Screen (actors)
- Actors on stage
- Cameras (being projected, creating projection background)
- Isadora station
- Grip (moving projectors, changing wires)

### Recap & Discussion (10-20 min)
