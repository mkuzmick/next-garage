# TDM172 Performance on tables and screens

## Course
**TDM172:** Performing Outside the Theater
**Instructor:** Tania Brugera
**Teaching Fellow:** Rachel Share-Sapolsky

**Course description:** *Artists can de-naturalize things that were always there. They can transform a modest action into an unforgettable experience. Discreet performances can liberate forgotten feelings.  But, are we trained to ¨see¨ outside the theater? Could a bench on a park be the perfect place to experience a dramatic plot? Would your kitchen table be the best set for a scene? In this class we are going to experience the displacement of theatrical constructions. We are taking the ¨frame¨ of theater and situate it in diverse environments and situations (from your living room to the street to a phone call to a post on social media). We’ll experiment with duration (from a minute performance to a semester long performance) to understand the potential of our scripts.*


## Event
Location: LL Main Studio
Time: Tuesday, October 14, (10-11:45AM)
Number of Students: 12

## Purpose

The purpose of this workshop is to give students a taster of how tabletops, film, and projection can be used as a frame for performance  


## Room and Tech Layout

List out mechanics:

- green screen
- tablescape with green paper
- Live video feed
- big projection screen
- table top projector area
- small studio audio: reflecting on tables and screens as alternative frames for live performance. They will improvise high-theory monologues. Maybe pre-populate with passages of alternative 


## Outline of Workshop

* Introduction to Learning Lab 
* Stations

### Main tablescape

- green paper
- chroma keyer
- cards


### Greenscreen

- Green screen
- Live video feed of green screen on big projection screen?
- Also maybe across 3 screens using isadora?

### Small studio 
- small studio audio: improvising high-theory monologues?

### Mini table projection installation
- cardboard surfaces?
- projecting traveling live feed?
- "mini" tools
    - mini projectors
    - prtining film & markers
    - hands

- Tabel "happenings?"
> “happenings” became a famous type of performance art during the 1960s. It centered around the involvement of the audience and for the first time brought improvisation into the act of performance. The idea that anything could happen during these performances and that what took place might never be repeated exactly again was characteristic of these events

Providing tools to have an impromptu collaborative performance on the table? They are given:

A mini projector
A camera (connected to the projector)
Printing film & markers
Cards

- Projection of green screen - traveling to different surfaces:
    - chalkboard? 
    - Fabrics? 
    - People?


## mk notes


### outside the theatre inside the Learning Lab: quick studies in tables and screens

In this workshop we'll investigate two alternative sites for theatrical production that we use a great deal in the Learning Lab: tables and screens.

The table is like the stage in that it's a horizontal platform, but whereas the stage (deriving from the Latin *stare* "to stand")


### random thoughts

- terms and concepts
    - theater (from Greek theatron, from theasthai ‘behold’.)
    - stage (from L "to stand")
    - proscenium / frame 
    - table (from L "board, plank, list")
    - tableau (from F "little table" for painting)
    - tableau noir et tableau blanc (blackboards, whiteboards)
    - tableau vivant (living picture)
    - screen (germanic, barrier, initially to protect from something dangerous; windscreen, firescreen, rom Proto-Indo-European *(s)ker-* (“to cut, divide”))
    - projection (project, "throw forth")
    - display (as with deploy, to "unfold"--but also scatter?)
    - surface (uppermost or external layer of something)
- when projecting, anything can be a screen

> In the ancient Greek theatre, the proscenium (Greek: proskēnion) originally referred to a row of colonnades, supporting a raised acting platform (logeion), and afterward to the entire acting area.

> From French tableau, from Old French tablel (“a surface which is used primarily for painting”).
