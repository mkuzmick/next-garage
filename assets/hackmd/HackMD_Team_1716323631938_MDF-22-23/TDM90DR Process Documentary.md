# TDM90DR Process Documentary

This month I've finished editing a 30 minute documentary for TDM90DR: Harvard Dance Project (HDP) Spring 2022. Over the course of the spring '22 semester, the Learning Lab filmed rehearsals, shows, and interviews of those involved in the course. The documentary tells the story of thee different creative processes of professional choreographers LROD, Aysha Upchurch, and Jeffrey Page, who set work on the HDP for the spring term. These works culminated in a final performance at Farkas Hall in April 2022. This film can also be easily cut into three shorter 10-minute films that highlight each choreographic work.

## Film Structure

The film begings with an introductory montage of rehearsal footage synched with a of the course by course instructor, LROD.

It then introduces each choreographic piece, starting with an introduction of the choreographer and a couple of questions about thier vision & process. It then cuts to a few student interviews, all along splicing in rehearsal & performance footage.

Each choreographers' section ends with a longer explanation of a particular part of their piece, and ends with an elongated clip of the final product.
