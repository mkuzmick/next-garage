# TDM98 + Learning Lab Proposal 

### For the Spring 2022-2023 school year, the [Learning Lab](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/learning-lab) will be working with TDM to support courses in design, documentation, and media literacy. This partnership will be spearheaded by [Jessi Stegall](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/people/jessi-stegall), a Media & Design Fellow at the Learning Lab. 


#### In partnering with the Junior Capstone courses, Jessi will offer workshops at the Learning Lab (pictured below) that will set students up for success in documenting, displaying, and integrating media in their senior thesis projects. Some workshops Jessi could offer the Junior Capstone students include: 



* [Learning about the value and possibilies of digital portfolios](#Who,-What,-Why-Portfolios?)
* [Generating Media-Inclusive Capstone Ideas](#Generating-Media-Inclusive-Capstone-Ideas) 
* [Introduction to Process Documentation](#Introduction-to-Process-Documentation)
* [Organization and curation methods (artist statements, social media branding, project descriptions)](#Branding-Yourself-and-the-Work)

Additionally, Jessi will offer optional individualized support to students through:

* [1:1 Media-integration support](#Personalized-capstone-media-support)
* [Meta-cognitive interviews over time](#Iterative-student-interviews)

## Additional Support

### Personalized capstone media support

In addition to providing workshops that introduce all capstone students to media tools, Jessi will also be available as a personalized support for students who have an interest in incorporating a media component into their final thesis project. These meeting would be by appointment and would go beyond the baseline information provided in the workshops.

### Iterative student interviews
    
If students are interested in documenting their own thinking throughout their process in a meta-cognitive format, Jessi is available to record & edit interviews with the students throughout the semester. At the end of their project, students will recieve an edited compilation of themselves that tracks how their thinking has developed over time.
