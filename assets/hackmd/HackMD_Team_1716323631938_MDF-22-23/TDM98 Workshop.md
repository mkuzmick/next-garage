# TDM98 Workshop 

3 students in the course
Each are writing a script - trying to develop their world


Problem 1:
Lots of students write plays for their final projects because its "less work"

Problem 2:
Students aren't learning to draw from discourse, e.g. Who else has made work like this?

So far their have written manifestos
This week they are presenting on an artist that inspires them

James wants them to develop ideas around what is possible with the idea they have started - he is going to ask them to write 2 pages of a script from their ideas

What else is possible?
How can we help them think about developing their ideas beyond paper?

This week students will be presenting on artists they are interested in emulating through the frames of form and process. What kind of work do they do? How do they go about doing it? We also check in each week on the projects they have in development.




Legitimate outputs:

- pitch deck 
- 


paper prototyping

- having them go through storyboarding on card, adding camera elements, adding green screen 

- 10 second interviews, 3 different perspectives 

- expert vs. novice audiences and formal vs. informal settings

think about the array of audiences you need to articulate your ideas to: the producers, presenters, stagehands, designers, front of and back of house, and actors 

what do you say if you're interviewed by NPR vs. to an audience on stage 

using the green screen for different pitch environments 

table read


studio filters table read 

- we should lean into the media stuff. 

ideas:
- protyping of the production could be valuable 
    - paper protypung the world, table reading, intergating them into the paper prototyping world. What is the role of prototyping? 

- if there are pieces of media that people have to create (pitch decks, mood boards, set diagrams), can we do activities having them pitch in different formats

- tour of the sense through media. create a 20 second soundscape. some stages they can depart from the 2


projections:

- if students are comfortable with creative suite, 
- some people don't have that visual artist eye or tech eye. 

questions andrew asks:
- you say projections or media - what does that actually mean to you?
- expectation making. what is the essence of what you are tyring to present

- presenting the options of what is actually possible. give them some basic technology information

- have them create a storyboard. here is your set: X of things that are your projection surfaces or media srufaces. We make a storyboard of what they are hoping for. 

people on stage and media need to be integrated. we don't have to turn off the lights and stop to play a video. when they do their storyboards, create stick figures to show what is the driving force of that content. Identify the place in the play that call for projection 

- explain what extent of flexibility there is

- how do we create that content that you want to be projected. so they need to learn filmmaking. 

video should be thought of as scenic elements, and should follow the timeline of the scenic elements 

1. visioning/storyboarding
1. content creation
2. learning the technology 
3. queing and transitions

prototype the interaction before its too late 
rehearsing projections in the same way you would costuming, scenic, and prop, and set elements.

teaching students how to think about using media rather than worrying about the technology 

milumin 

isadora and Qlab can both control lights as well 



maybe hekpufl to clarify vocabulary


next steps:

- follow up with andrew re: tour of farkas and sackler projection systems


NDI tools: moniter
have people download app 

screen capture out of isadora 

set up a time to prototype laura's live interaction idea with NDI tools 


TDM course techniques in theatre technology
