## How will the Learning Lab support this project?

Jessi (MDF) will support the art installation aspect of this project in two ways:

1. [Filming process + product](#Filming)
2. [Teaching editing skills](#Editing)
3. [Small lobby installation for performance](#Lobby-installation)
4. [Digital portfolio for project](#Digital-portfolio)

### Filming 

Recruiting the help of the LLUFs, the LL will film some of Laura's rehearsals throughout the year, as well as record one of her performances in March. This provides an opportunity for LLUFs to learn basic filming techniques, particularly for capturing movement on camera.

### Editing

Jessi will teach Laura how to use FCPX to make edits of her rehearsal footage and brand the work on social media.

### Lobby installation

For Laura's performances on March 23-26, Jessi will help Laura create a micro-installation in the Farkas Lobby for her performances, where she can showcase some of her research, potentially utilizing the green screen to show how key concepts overlap and differ between contact improvisation and break dancing.
