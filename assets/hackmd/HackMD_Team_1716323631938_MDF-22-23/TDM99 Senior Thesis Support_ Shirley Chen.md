# TDM99 Senior Thesis Support: Shirley Chen
**Fall 2022**
**Advisor: Ju Yon Kim**

For her Senior Thesis Project, Shirley performed a one-woman show at Sackler Oct 21-21. She spent the summer in San Fransisco researching the ***Miss Chinatown USA Pageant***, where she interviewed former contestants and used this data to create four fictional characters who she plays in her production.

In addition to her performance, Shirley wanted to set up an interactive art installation outside of the theatre that included historical artifacts that informed the production, including photos, newspaper articles, videos, and garments. 

## How did the Learning Lab support this project?

Jessi (MDF) supported the project by the interactive art installation aspect of this project in two ways:

1. [Support the general curation and design of the space](#General-installation-design/curation)
2. [Provide technological equipment and support for projection in the installation](#Projections)

## General installation design/curation


**What did we do?**

By pairing objects, physical images, and projection, Jessi supported Shirley's installation by:


1. Consulting Shirley on the design of vignette-style areas with vintage household items



2.  Developing a suspension method that used hooks, fishing wire, and clips to hang clothing, fabrics, props, hands with the help of LLUFs

3.  Consulting with Shirley on the design of telling a story through speciality images of contestants and newspaper articles about their lives, which included researching previous exhibits and gathering images of various methods

4.  Experimenting with projection use in ways that minimize the technology seen and maintain a retro experience

5. Facilitating an **INSTALLATION DAY** in which Jessi, Shirley & a team of Learning Lab Undergraduate Fellows completed the tedious work of installing the different elements of the installation, including hanging 300+ photos and suspending clothing garments, fabrics, props, and images from the cieling.

**What equipment did we provide?**

* small hooks and clips to hang from ceiling and hang clothes 
* printing out the specialty 11x17 photos to be mounted on the wall
* large-scale fabric swatches
* Camera for documentation


## Projections


**What did we do?**

Jessi & Casey set up projectors around the installation that blended into the established vintage mood. They used three methods of projection placement:

1. Placing a medium-sized projector inside an old TV and hanging vellum where the screen would be to give the illusion of a working vintage television.

2. Suspending a small wireless pocket projector from the ceiling to project onto a smaller vintage TV.
