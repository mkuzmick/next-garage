## Course Support

### French 30: Current Events and Media in the Francophone World

In support of students' podcast projects, Therese facilitated the French 30 workshop, during which students were encouraged to reflect on the practice and capturing of live interviews. Then, Therese had students experiment with capturing sound using microphones, instructing students on how to position themselves in relationship to the mic to ensure the best audio quality. Finally, Therese had students work in small groups to stage interview set ups on camera, in a kind of live podcast setup that students are familiar with from social media platforms. There were also several other stations at this workshop: one where students learned about performance techniques that are relevant to the podcasting form (i.e., using one's voice effectively, being intentional about intonation, projection, anunciation) and another station where students were introduced to an audio editing tool that they could use to edit their podcasts.

### French 40: The Contemporary Francophone World Through Cinema

In French 40, students create short films that deploy the formal elements from films they study in the course. They also develop scripts and learn to edit their films. In support of this project, Therese helped faciliate a workshop at the Learning Lab where students analyzed and then recreated cinematic moves from the films they had viewed in the class so far. One station had students think about shooting using gimbals and other stabilizing equipment, enabling high-quality capture with phones. At another station, students recreated the conventional shot-reverse-shot set up--used frequently in narrative films during dialogues between characters--while at another station, students thought about shot length, framing, and composition. Finally, students learned about lighting a shot, thinking about the ways in which lighting structures the viewer's emotional experience of a scene in a film.

## Department Support

### Teaching Videos Subtitling

Working closely with the department's language program, Therese created English subtitles for teaching demonstration films that are in multiple languages represented in the department (e.g., Italian, French). This project allows department members--no matter their particular area of expertise--to learn from these teaching demonstration videos. 

### Graphic Design for Live Events

In support of RLL's in-person events, Therese has designed posters advertising departmental happenings. Therese has deployed her skills in graphic design to design posters that promote the opportunities for in-person engagement in RLL.

## Learning Lab Training

### audio/video 

Media & Design Fellows identify key tools they need to learn in order to complete their projects. They join internal labs to receive training and practice using these tools. They also shadow experienced MDFs and Learning Lab staff as they design prompts and lead workshops. 

Teaming up with an audio/video lab, Therese developed her skills in audio/video editing and assignment design, looking to further her skills in video production as she works on the RLL teaching demo video project.
