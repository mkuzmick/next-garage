# Things to propose to TDM in the spring:

- TDM-wide projection workshop
- Faculty night: a taste of the Learning Lab (inviting both faculty and TAs) maybe collab with music? maybe frame as a happy hour with taster stations
- An updated look book
    - include the "mini" creative assignments for weekly responses
    - workshops for creative assignments (video essays, podcasts, filmed interviews, tik toks)
    -
