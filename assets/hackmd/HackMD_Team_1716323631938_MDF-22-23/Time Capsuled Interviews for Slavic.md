# Time Capsuled Interviews for Slavic
## What is it?
Using documentary-style interviews, students will be given the opportunity to document progress and changes in their learning, language skills, and goals throughout a course or project.

In language courses, students sometimes struggle to recognize their progress throughout the semester. If they record a few times in the semester, they'd be able to see themselves progress! 
## What would it look like?
Depending on the level, we could ask them a variety of different questions (in the target language).
- We could have them simply introduce themselves to begin, and we could watch those introductions become more developed and nuanced. 
- They could tell us about the most challenging thing they're learning, or a part of the language they're struggling with, too. Sometimes, students don't remember how hard the previous task was. For example, when a student is learning verbs of motion later in the semester, they may think they just can't get them. But, if they look back at themselves trying to understand nominative plural a few months earlier, they could recognize how they've overcome learning challenges and how things that were once difficult have become natural to them!
- On a similar note, they could tell us something that they've finally been able to grasp or that they really understand
- They could tell us some favorite words or phrases 
- They could tell us what they think about the language they're learning in general, or about the topic (if the course is more thematic).
- They could tell us about themselves as a language learner! It would be interesting to see that grow.
- They could share some of their upcoming goals as they go forward in learning the language

## How would we do it?
- Option 1: The Learning Lab (where I work as an MDF) has state-of-the art recording equipment and editing capacities. They could come in (or I could bring the cameras to them and interview them one at a time while the others do something else?) and then I could get a team of our undergraduate fellows to work on some of the editing!
- Option 2: We can do less technologically intense versions of this, and have them use something like Flipgrid to upload their own videos. (Thanks, Liya, for the idea), so as not to use class-time
- Option 3: We could combine this and have cameras they could check out from me to record themselves outside of class (or interview each other!)


## Examples
We've seen great examples of this in the TDM program, as shown here:

And here is the inspiration:
