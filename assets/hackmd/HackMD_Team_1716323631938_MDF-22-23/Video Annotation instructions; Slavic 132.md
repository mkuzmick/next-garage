# Video Annotation instructions; Slavic 132

For this assignment, you will be adding annotations to a clip of a ballet. 

If you remember when we did text annotations on Perusall, video annotations will be some what familiar!

Each of the ballets that you will be watching for class is embedded on Perusall. Your task is to annotate a video of your choosing with four annotations. To do this, you'll add a comment by clicking on "Add Comment" in the top right corner at the moment you want to annotate in the video, like so:

In each annotation, think about how you're working with video. How is this, video annotation, different from annotating a text or describing a video through text? How can you best use this platform and its affordances?

Then, in the discussion post, you'll write the four time stamps that you chose to annotate, so we can keep track and look at what you had to say!
