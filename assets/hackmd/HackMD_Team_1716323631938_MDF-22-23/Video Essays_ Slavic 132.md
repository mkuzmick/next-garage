# Video Essays: Slavic 132

Video essays deploy visuals, audio, and sometimes text in order to make an argument or convey key data to an audience. Let's unpack the start of a video together and think about its moves, much in the same way that we just did with the podcast episode.

Some great examples of video essays include these Now This videos [about Title 42](https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/1512891348218699778) and [border and climate politics](https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/1513246186546683905), as well as the Vox "explainer"-style video below about a chair featured on multiple album covers.

# Making a video essay about literature

- Think about what a video, and visual data, can communicate: you're not just recreating a paper!
- To communicate visually, you may need to draft visually! You can do a practice round on paper or on whichever platform you end up making your video essay. When you're drafting, you don't need to know your final point! You can use the drafting process to figure out what it is exactly you'd like to communicate. 
- Think about the moves you're making! How does each aspect of your video essay contribute to your overall essay? How do you use elements to guide us through your thoughts?
    - For example, if you're zooming in on an image, *why* are you doing so? Are you highlighting something about it, emphasizing an aspect of it? You don't want to zoom just for fun!
- Similarly, think about the types of points you want to make and how you can use different moves to make them!
    - For example, if you know you want to contrast two ideas, you have a lot of options- you could use contrasting music clips, or you could have images overlaying or beside each other, or you could use color to establish a contrasting pattern or... so much more! The important thing here is thinking about the point you want to make and using a visual move to best highlight it.
- You don't need to do too much! Just like in a written essay, it's important to be concise while still getting all your points across. Think carefully about the moves & elements you're moving! You don't have to add extra elements just because it's visual.

### Downloading from YouTube

By far the safest and most reliable way to download from YouTube is to use [youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org/), a simple command line tool. 

To use it on Windows:
1. install [choco](https://chocolatey.org/install) if you don't already have it
2. `choco install youtube-dl`
3. then `youtube-dl "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"` or other URL

To use it on Mac:
1. install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you don't already have it
2. `brew install youtube-dl`
3. then `youtube-dl "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"` or other URL

If you want a specific format:
1. `youtube-dl -F [your/URL]` to see all formats so you can select the number of the format you want--let's say "22"
2. `youtube-dl -f 22 [your/URL]` to download

be sure to `cd /Users/me/Desktop/folder-i-want-my-stuff-in` first!

You can also use online methods at your own risk.
