# Workshop: visual and oral communication 
Statement of Purpose: Aimed at senior thesis writers (course=99A), this workshop will give students writing an honors thesis a chance to think about how they present their research. This will help them for their required presentations of their work, which happen at the end of both semesters. This workshop can also be open to juniors taking 98, looking toward their capstone for this course. 

## Goals
* learn about the principles of visual design: visual communication
* learn how to succinctly communicate their thesis and big picture ideas: oral communication
* give the students a chance to practice talking about their research projects in a low stakes environment without their thesis advisor overlooking 

## Potential activities
* critique a presentation 
    * this is the video we like to use of Steve Jobs announcing the ipad

* CRAP(contrast, repetition, alignment, proximity) acronym for visual design
* practice making a philology handout
* slide and image critique or practice
    * maybe walk them through ClassicsWrites together for image best practices? I don;t want to see any bad slides or pixelated images!!! 
* Workshop an elevator pitch of their thesis as it stands: get them up on the green screen stage to present it to the group: film. record and re-watch  

## practicalities
* figure out date and time: when is the fall colloquium for thesis presentations (usually November?), and when can this workshop would be most helpful to students: maybe early Nov. so they have a good amount of research done before their presentation 
* when can most students come? do students work at night? should we poll them? 
* can/ how do we get buy in?
    * food/ catering: Teresa says there is dept money for pizza but not much else
    * soft requirement? 
    * get DUS support
