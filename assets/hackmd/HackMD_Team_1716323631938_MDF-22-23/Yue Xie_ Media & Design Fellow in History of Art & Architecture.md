## Course Support

### HAA99A: Senior Thesis

Yue supported senior thesis writers in HAA, providing feedback to students about their projects, including both their presentations and the visuals they intend to analyze during their presentations. Yue hosted several workshops for the students at the Learning Lab. The first workshop introduced students to the fundamentals of capture and photo editing--skills that will help students create high-quality images for their presentation slides. Yue also hosted a workshop that helped students develop their arguments. In this workshop, students visualized their arguments, arranging important concepts, figures, and theories around a central "anchoring" concept. Visualizing their arguments using arts supplies helped students think about the need to develop the connection between the different components of their arguments and this central concept. 

### HAA265R: Northern Renaissance Art Virtual Galleries

Media & Design Fellows Yue Xie (History of Art & Architecture) and Siriana Lundgren (Music) helped Professor Koerner prototype a virtual gallery for his course on Northern Renaissance art. For their final gallery projects in this course, students design and curate a virtual gallery based on the exact dimensions and layout of a Harvard Art Museum gallery. 

### HAA 184G: Modern Ink Landscape

Yue supported Professor Eugene Wang's Modern Ink Landscape course, helping Professor Wang and the course's students record their final presentations in the Learning Lab studio. Professor Wang and the students delivered live versions of their final papers for the course, using the Learning Lab studio's cameras and microphones to record. Yue and Professor Wang are continuing to research possible ways to preserve and document student work through forms like these videos, looking into possible platforms for sharing edited versions of them.

### HAA73: Money Matters Creative Projects Workshop

Students in HAA73: Money Matters develop final creative projects in a range of media forms that allow them to share their findings about coins and their histories. At this workshop, students were introduced to a range of key tools they could use to make, display, and reflect on their coins, ranging from video and audio to 3D modeling and illustration. Then, students developed rationales and produced a paper prototype of their project, visualizing their content and structure.


## Department Support

### Digital Database of Online Resources in Art History

Yue is building a digital database that aggregates resources and makes them more accessible for researchers working in the field of the history of art and architecture. Eventually, this database will incorporate resources from different institutions, fields of study, and media of art. So far, Yue has created a small database for digital archives of Islamic manuscripts and similar resources. Yue's aim is to invite people to add things to and edit this open-access database.

## Learning Lab Training

Media & Design Fellows identify key tools they need to learn in order to complete their projects. They join internal labs to receive training and practice using these tools. They also shadow experienced MDFs and Learning Lab staff as they design prompts and lead workshops. 

Yue developed prototypes and workshops in web-based interactive essays as she learned with other MDFs about scrollytelling, a form used by publications like the New York Times. 

Using timelineJS, Yue made a proof of concept that performs the move of horizontal scrollytelling, telling the story of change over time.

This working group discovered that tools like arcGIS could be useful not only for the presentation of academic/intellectual insights, but also for guiding the process of arriving at those insights.  The group started to develop a list of "intellectual moves," or ways of interacting with images and/or textual excerpts, that can guide students' analyses and syntheses of primary or secondary source materials.
