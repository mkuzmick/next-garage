## Airtable in Unity Virtual Gallery Resource and Workshop

![](https://i.imgur.com/Cxi7Um8.jpg)

Tica further developed the virtual gallery project to link Unity to Airtable. Tica developed a framework in Unity that directly accesses a designated Airtable base with images and descriptive text. Then, Tica demonstrated an example scene that automatically loaded the art images and descriptions from Airtable in the virtual gallery in Unity. This tutorial and codebase can be found on [Github](https://github.com/ticahere/ll_Airtable-in-Unity). To demonstrate this workflow, Tica offered a workshop in Unity to a group of Learning Lab Undergraduate Fellows and Media & Design Fellows during the spring term. This gave Tica the opportunity to practice teaching a highly technical tool.
