# av-lab's 20221104 designLab write up
###### tags: `av-lab`
## Details
November 4, 2022 1:30-3:00 PM
Learning Lab, Main Studio
## Objective
* Participants will 1) explore the differences in what and how they are able to communicate information when creating videos that feature either audio or visual content and 2) get practice adjusting how they communicate to different audiences.
* LLUFs will gain useful experience articulating the importance of the work they are doing

## Summary of the lab
* Showed examples and led a discussion at the start of the workshop (~30 minutes)
    * Example videos:
        * Audio focused: [Astrophysicist Answers Questions from Twitter (just talking to the camera)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mt3eexuKelg)
        * Visual focused: [Central Dogma Overhead Camera and Paper Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCblY7YoyKA)
        * Demonstration of talking to different audiences: [Neuroscientist Explains One Concept at 5 Levels of Difficulty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opqIa5Jiwuw&list=PLibNZv5Zd0dyCoQ6f4pdXUFnpAIlKgm3N)
    * Prompts addressed in discussion:
        * Where do you see videos used in the classroom?
        * What is valuable about the format of the explainer video?
        * What do you think works/doesn't work in the video examples?
        * Why is the type of explainer video where information is explained at different levels of complexity interesting/useful?
        * Why do you think making explainer videos would be useful for undergraduate education?
        * What is useful about the video format of a person talking to the camera (oral-focused)? What do you gain with this format?
        * What is useful about the video format of overhead capture of graphics like paper models (visual-focused)? What do you gain with this format?
* Running the activity (~50 minutes)
    * We planned four stations creating four different videos. Students were allowed to choose the station most interesting to them. We ended up with groups working on all of these stations except for visual explainer to an expert audience.
        * Oral explainer to novice audience (conducted with student sitting on stool talking to camera on tripod in main studio)
        * Oral explainer to expert audience (conducted with multiple students sitting behind table talking to camera in the small studio)
        * Visual explainer to novice audience (conducted using paper visuals and filmed on overhead camera at bench in the main studio)
        * Visual explainer to expert audience
    * Who are the audiences?
        * Novice = high school/new college student
        * Expert = faculty member or university administrator
    * What question did they address in the explainer videos?
        * Why are video assignments valuable in education?	
* Reflections after the activity (~10 minutes)
    * Students discussed what they thought about while creating their videos and how the activity made them think about the usefulness of explainer videos in different classroom contexts.  Students also provided feedback on the workshop's efficacy and how it could be improved if conducted in the future.

## Reflections
The students had a lively discussion at the start of the session about ideas inspired by the video examples.  There were several interesting ideas about how the different video formats conveyed information and engaged the audience. For example, we discussed how different formats might be more approriate for sharing different types of information or for explaining something in a different tone/to a different target audience. Students also discussed the interesting similarities and differences in how information was explained to different audiences in the video example with the neuroscientist. For instance, students noted the similarity in using analogies (just of diffferent levels of complexity and subtlety) to explain the concept.

The activity led to students creating interesting and engaging videos. Students were thoughtful about their choice of terminology and analogies depending on the audience they were targeting. They were creative in how they answered a relatively abstract and open-ended question. In addition, the differences in how the two groups creating oral-focused videos set up the camera and shot their videos also seemed intentional based on the audience they were targeting.

After creating the videos, the students provided insight into what they learned in the process. Students noted some different instances they thought of explainer videos being useful in the classroom that they previously had not considered. For instance, one student mentioned that he thought it would be a useful study exercise to create such videos in place of or in addition to study guides when preparing for an exam. Students also offered feedback on the workshop. They found the content of the workshop interesting but desired more time for making the videos and suggested that the time required to create a polished video (particularly for the visual group) surpassed what we could do within the time constraints of a workshop. The students also would have been interested in being able to preview what the other stations created.
