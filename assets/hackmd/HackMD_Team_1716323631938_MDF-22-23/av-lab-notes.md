# av-lab-notes
## 20221118
* Discussion about the format of the chalk talk and the idea to film videos of this format
* Topic could be anything- philosophy, scienc
* Experimenting with shots that would be helpful- potentially 3? One pointing at the board, one at the person, and one at both
* Discussed when we see chalk talks arising in different disciplines
* Discussed how the format of the chalk talk differs from conference talks or from talks with PowerPoints
* Something performative about it, emerging from the speaker, how it affects how the audience perceives the speaker's sense of authority
* Thinking about what we want to do for next year

### Ideas Brainstorm (what are we excited about learning?)
* genres of film and video making, common moves you can make in a film/non-writing
* what video assignments would be appropriate for foreign language/literature classes?
** example: video about a person's life in Chinese class was helpful to students to showcase what they learned
* what do you gain by different things you can show in movies? What can you get through which mode of doing something visually/through film? This way, you can discern what may be more helpful for a certain project over another
* learning After Effects!!! 
** Example: Project Harvard Horizons and visual communications 
* learning more video editing (in general) 
* Keynote for animation 
* Non-Fiction video making 
* Editing in Premiere
** Sophie is good with premiere! 
* Music 
** creating music with things like logic, creating music videos 
** Ex. logic loops! 
* How Cameras Work!!! 
** how different things you do affect the quality of the film, etc. 
** apature, ISO, etc. 
* Video Editing 

### Learning Project Ideas 
* Short film to edit 
** get the expereince of video editing 
* Connecting music to video: maybe using logic to create a music bed for the video we create 
* Edit the tiktok dance videos into a video?
* Interview Editing 
* Loop/Montage videos 
* Explanatory video
** incorperating videos as something students can use to show how things work visually (plus music if we want)
* Interview format, but videos that show behind the scenes that supports what is being discussed (ex. wired interviews that explain how something is done to someone foreign to the topic)
* take a concept from a class/or research that may not be clear to someone outside of your practice/class and then explain it to someone. Make visuals or audio that add to the explanation and video as a whole 
* Profile of a tool (Ex. one minute on the button machine, cards, etc. can get video of the tool being used)
** what video would be best to help explain how to use this tool, what script would be most helpful, etc. 
* How it's made button making parody :) 

### people's individual interests
* Jordan: explainer video of how to do a profile of a tool
* Sarah: explainer video on question - what is an ancient greek hero?
* Charlie: explain a concept 
* Christine: telling the story of a process (ex. profile of a tool)
* Allure: story actually 
* Brenda: story of a place 
* DÃ©zhawn: group project (ex. my favorite things, hobbies, etc) interview/montage. Way to learn tools that we have 
* Emily: explainer video about concept that seems jargony but is fundamental to discipline (ex. what is mRNA) 
* Therese: explainer video about a concept (but in French!) montage/visuals included, art included

### explainer video learning 
* key elements of interview setup 

### Goals for Next Sessions
* find examples of interviews 
* find shots that we'd want to duplicate
* find edits that we find cool to use later
* MODELS of things!!! 



### studies and things to practice
- if you haven't **edited** anything before, practice FCPX or Resolve or Premiere by finding a reference video you like and cutting it up into pieces (making a cut for each cut). 
    - This will make you faster at the tool and also help you analyze the piece
    - you can also reorganize the clips if you want to get a sense of their basic categories, how many of each there are, etc.
- if you haven't **shot** anything before (and are documenting a process) then take at least an hour to shoot that process
    - capture from multiple distances and angles (for each and every discrete step of the process)
- if you are making an **explainer** video, either
    - try recording yourselve improvising an explanation, or
    - write a script and read it aloud
    - but in either case, time yourself and figure out just how much you can say in that amount of time
- if you like the idea of recording interviews, let's set up a session on how to light, mic and record an interview that everyone can come to

### prompt ideas

for modular 1 minute videos

- 1 minute micro explainer videos
- 1 minute videos that are entries in an encyclopedia or glossary
- why video projects explained in 5 ways (rather than 5 levels of difficulty)
    - these will differ based on type of video (explainer vs interview vs video essay, etc)
    - also based on departmental context
- story of a process
- story of a place
- story of an LL process at 2 levels of difficulty
    1. how to
    2. why to
- show and tell: interview someone for 60 seconds about
    - a thing they did (that you filmed)
    - a thing they made (that they have with them and that you document)
    - a place (that you capture with them)
