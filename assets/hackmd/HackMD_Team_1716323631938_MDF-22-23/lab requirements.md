# lab requirements


## resources + where to share
* Find models, resources, references, and tutorials that help future learners explore the medium, form, etc. of your lab
    * make a list of these!
    * share these on Slack in your lab channel!
* Share those resources in your lab's Slack channel
    * each member of the lab should contribute to this channel to help make it an active community of learners
* Make a list of possible learning projects
    * share these on Slack!
    * keep track of these/make notes about them in hackmd!
* Determine a concrete microproject you can complete in 4-6 weeks
    * share this on Slack so that anyone who missed the meeting will know what everyone is working on!
* Launch your project by describing the project in a project doc (on google drive)
    * share this project description in #ll-show-your-work

## lab meetings
* Meet once a week on a day/time of your choosing to work as a group on the lab project
    * asynchronous tasks can be good, too! but we definitely encourage working as a group in person as much as possible
