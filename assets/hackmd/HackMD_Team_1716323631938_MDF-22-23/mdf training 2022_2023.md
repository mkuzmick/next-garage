office hours - who showed up, what we were teaching them

add to a new version of the resources base?

experimental project base
sync in projects or the plan (with DD)


teachings and learnings tables in the work base?
sometimes this would link to tasks or projects 

the learning base
where the minis and things go too
focused on curriculum development and learning and less on project management (like project docs and consultations)
get RESOURCES in here

teaching events: toolTimes, workshops (specific time associated with it)
