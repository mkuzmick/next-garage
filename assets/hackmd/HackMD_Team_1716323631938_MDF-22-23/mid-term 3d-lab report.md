# mid-term 3d-lab report

## annotated maps
For their initial learning project, 3dLab decided to explore the 3d modeling tool Blender. They imported and in some cases built maps; this aspect of the lab's initial project involved learning techniques like subdividing, lighting, and material textures. The lab also annotated their individual maps, modeling assets in Blender or importing them from sites like SketchFab. By choosing meaningful objects to annotate their maps, 3dLab created maps that performed an analytical move: Looking at the objects on the map tells the viewer about key locations, while it also gives some sense of what data this map can be used to analyze.

Chris built a map of New York City, showing a river flowing through the city. Chris shared his process: "I'm interested in the potential 3d rendering has to portray alternative realities and things that are not real/not possible. So this is an imagining of Times Square based on the "Sanitary & Topographical Map of the City and Island of New York (1865)", known as the Viele Map, where the waterways marked on the map still flow through the familiar space. The scenes are modeled in Blender and then assembled and sound added in Davinci Resolve."

Siriana created an annotated map of the US West, which is the subject of her dissertation research in the Music department. Siriana chose a historical map of a red light district, using subdividing to add texture to the map.

Marlon designed a map showing where the Learning Lab is located. 

## designing assets

3dLab also designed assets in Blender for a range of purposes.

Siriana learned to animate in Blender, using a camera to orbit around an object.

To prepare for a video games course that they're supporting in the English department in the spring term, Carly built a stack of books. Carly wanted to know how challenging and time-consuming it would be for students in this course to design simple game assets, so they built these books from scratch. Now, they'll have a better sense of how to support students in this course, having worked in the tool that students are likely to use.

Chris built a smoking pumpkin in preparation for the annual 3d pumpkin carving day at the Learning Lab!

Recalling a workshop we offered for a GENED course on animation, Carly designed a No-Face pumpkin. To do this, Carly drew the face, then traced it in Adobe Illustrator, and then brought it into Blender.

Carly also made a more standard jack-o'-lantern. 

## donuts! 
And, of course, 3dlab built some donuts, following the classic Blender tutorial! This YouTube tutorial is a great way to learn the basics of the tool.
