# mid-term av-lab report
avLab took on an initial learning project in short video, producing explainer-style videos and short process films. Some lab members captured their own footage, while others learned about sourcing assets and using found footage to make short videos. Working in different tools, avLab also explored different editing workflows, including importing movie files from Keynote and recording voiceover in Final Cut.

## explainer videos

Using found footage and the video editing tool Final Cut, Sarah made a short explainer-style video about the Parthenon. Sarah wrote a script and then recorded the voiceover audio in Final Cut. She experimented with different animations in Keynote as well, importing these clips into her video timeline so that the video contained some simple animations.

Emily also worked in the explainer-style video genre, producing a short video about common "dogmas" in the field of biology. Emily experimented with sound effects and animations, adding humor into her explainer video as a way to mimic the style of some public-facing scientific videos that attempt to reach a broad audience. She also designed simple animations in Keynote and imported these into the video editor. 

## capture

avLab also learned about cameras and mics and the basics of capture.
