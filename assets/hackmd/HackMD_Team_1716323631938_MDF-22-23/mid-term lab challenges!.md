## wrapping up initial learning projects
For the past month or so, your labs have taken on first learning projects, as a way of developing your skills in some of the key tools that are used to create the media in your lab's zone. 
* [3dLab has been prototyping 3D annotated maps](https://hackmd.io/HfkToOj2TZuPDsCn3wktAA) with sound and animations in Blender
* [avLab has been prototyping short video essays](https://hackmd.io/SEgeu7UmTlWUB6t9TkQtzw) and learning about cameras and mics
* [scrollLab has made prototypes of scrolling websites](https://hackmd.io/H3o22XVYRNCaL8EiyGQrKg) using both low- and high-code tools

Now, we're ready to pivot from those initial learning projects and into the next stage of your work in the labs! We're going to celebrate this pivot with a **show and tell at our Friday, October 28 MDF meeting.** To prepare:
* Wrap up your initial learning projects by October 27
* Share media that documents what you made in the Slack channel #show-your-work
    * include an image
    * and some text describing what you made and how you made it
* note: it is OK if your prototype isn't perfect! these initial learning projects are a means to an end (with the end being your learning with your lab!).

## what will the labs do now?

We have two challenges for each of the labs that will help us pivot to the second half of the term.

After these challenges (both of which will take place on October 28), the labs will get together to think about their next projects.

### designLab challenge
At the October 28 MDF meeting, each of the labs will develop a plan for the remaining designLabs:
* November 4, 1:30 - 3:00
* November, 18, 1:30 - 3:00
* December 2, 1:30 - 3:00

Each lab should come up with an activity that they'd like to test out in designLab to get feedback from the Learning Lab Undergraduate Fellows and staff! Some questions that might help you as you come up with an activity:
* What are your learning goals for your activity?
* What analytical "moves" do you want students to learn/make during the activity?
* What framing can you provide at the outset that will help students understand:
    * what they are doing?
    * why they are doing it?
* What will students do during this activity? Describe any stations you might like to have. 
* come up with as many ideas as possible!!!

### pumpkin carving and documentation challenge!

On **Friday, October 28, we're going to host a Blender/3D pumpkin carving session at noon**! Please join us for this if you can.

[Check out this doc](https://hackmd.io/o-unCaBUSkSK2ifey5UgZw) for more info about the goals for this session, including workflows we're aiming to develop, as well as the Blender tutorial we'll use.

We're going to use the tools from all of the labs to carve and document the process of carving these pumpkins!
* **3dlab** will work in Blender to carve the pumpkins
* **avLab** will use cameras and mics to document the process (and thus tell the story of the process) of carving the pumpkins
* **scrollLab** will populate a scrolling website with footage from this event and shots of the pumpkins created
