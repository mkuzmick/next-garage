interrelated projects this semester
theme of helping students with sci comm
three courses: scrb 111, neuro 101, mcb 291
classes that are for both grads and u-grads
all about reading primary lit in science and talk about what they learned in different ways/forms
assignments are common - graphical abstracts, video abstracts, popular science videos addressing general public
emily interested in skills you have to learn for these different forms overlap
workshops that help students do these assignments - in visual representing data from primary source literature or complicated models and concepts, give students practice in oral presentations, making visuals dynamic and engaging - simple animations/graphics in motion 
paper prototyping to help them think about this


This semester, Media & Design Fellow Emily Rivard (MCB) is working on projects for three different courses: SCRB 111: Regeneration: Phenomena to Mechanisms, Neuro 101: Neurobiology of Emotion and Mood Disorders, and MCB 291: Genetics, Genomics and Evolutionary Biology. Despite being both undergraduate and graduate courses (MCB 291 is a graduate course), all focus on helping students learn to read primary literature in science and to talk about what they've learned, addressing different audiences (both specialist/scientific and public). 

The courses also overlap in terms of the forms students are encouraged to engage with and create. As students learn to read primary source literature and unpack complex theories and models for different audiences, they are also exploring forms that have increasing significance in scientific fields, including graphical abstracts, video abstracts, and oral presentation. 

Emily has developed workshops for these courses that aim to help students develop their skills in visual communication and presentations, starting with simple paper prototyping as a way to get students thinking creatively about how to visualize complex data.

 Helping RLL with graphic design support for RLL events
 events that the department hosts to help their teachers teach/develop their teaching
 engaging languages and literatures in other disciplines
 help dept pedagogy course - both for students taking the course and to give them examples of good teaching
 will be subtitling those videos - both those recorded durign the class and those used as examples
 make these videos more accessible to students
 give them a stable location to live so that they can be accessible in the future
 
Media & Design Fellow Therese Banks (RLL) has been providing graphic design support to Romance Languages & Literatures to help publicize their events about teaching and engaging languages and literatures in different disciplines. 
 
Therese has also been providing media support to the department's pedagogy course. Therese will produce subtitles for the videos that the pedagogy course uses to provide current students with examples of excellent teaching, as well as videos that are recording during the pedagogy course. The goal is to make these videos more accessible to students and to give the videos a stable location so that they can be easily accessed in the future.
