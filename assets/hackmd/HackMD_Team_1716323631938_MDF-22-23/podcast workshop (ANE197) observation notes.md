# podcast workshop (ANE197) observation notes 
multimodal multimedia academic communication
NB this workshop happened on oct. 5 of fall semester 

## intro ice/breaker: serial breakdown 
1. starts by listening to beginning of serial, c. 60 secs (plays it from the comp)

2. ask for observations/ first notices
* students notice soundtrack, connections to tone; spooky feeling, minor chords, something abnormal about it, no resolution in a major chord/ dissonant 

3. listen again 
* brings attention to the silence, and then big shift in turn; Jordan guides them to this move (narrative shift); then asks student for their thoughts again 
* asks for student input again 
* a hook in the narrative
* students finally get the phone call (what do they notice the second time that they didn't the first) NB this could be a good time to talk about sources 
* Jordan draws attention to the change in qualities between the collect call and the other audio: what is the effect of this 

chapter headings in academic writing: visual cues that help to emphasize whats happening and structure that experience: how do you make these moves in audio: pauses, shifts, how do you starts to trust the narrator  

podcasts allows for narrative shifts and disjunctions in a way that you can't do in an academic text 

expectations that something is wrong: the problem of your narrative

4. third listen: Jordan reveals all the elements she wants you to listen to
* audio, pause, base, collect call, introduction, narration,  
* Key move in podcasting: make you like the narrator, give it a personal investment; unlike in academic writing where you want to be objective
* key use of different mics and stuff to make meaning

Overview of rest of lesson which will include Garage band tutorial of making a podcast  
## garage band tutorial 
### note that the students are not limited to GB, but for the sake of ease we choose one to workshop
* the lesson will occur in the LL on the macs there 
note to self: maybe look up some GB tutorials 
* all stories start with a puzzle or obstacle: identify it and make connections (theory to source; past to present, etc.); the difficulties in making the connections is what payoff worth it  
NB there is preloaded audio that jordan already prepared 
1. asks students to find a soundbite to pull as their "primary source": gives them headphones and time to do this
* if you want to take an excerpt, drag playhead to start and hit command T to trim 
* then you delete whatever you don't want, drag and drop, etc. 
2. asks them to record something to introduce it 
there are a lot of people available to go to each station to help everyone learn the software 
* play with distance of mouth to mic to get the sound and effect you want

## share a student workout with the group
maybe an option for a reflection? 


## the follow up workshop in the LL ...
...will be a working session for their own actual podcast where they can record and troubleshoot
