# scroll-lab notes

## 20221021
what would be the purpose and audience for the pumpkin scroll? goal: we want to be able to put together a website or a gallery quickly after an event here - this challenge builds out that capacity

designLab activity for scroll-lab
* blocking out text to highlight (erasure poem - students create poem out of different versions of the poem)
    * inverse highlighting
* process of revision
* tablescape as a screen - students scroll things through
* GIS station for celia to practice teaching

celia teaching GIS this coming week!

Thinking about the "move" of redaction, removing the dominant elements in a text - how would this shape students' experience of that text

Removing information from a map - what does this allow you to see? Structure, etc.

Cutting and pasting - taking from one context and putting it into another; analogous to taking street art and bringing it into museums - what does this do to an image?

Getting students to think about an object in a context

Drawing and mapping in ethnographic methods - Shanni talked about students being asked to draw a map of Harvard Square and then students analyze the choices they made; what gets captured/visualized/included

paper prototyping

students using overhead cameras - capturing their prototypes and then getting it into something that would get it into something killer; can we automate little bits of it?
Using live captioning as the narrative part?

glossary of the "moves" - unpacking why you'd do, say, a zoom; have a 1-page write up of this with some media; as a resource for a course

for designLab:
* students do series of manipulation to a series of things (text, map, image)
* different operations
* design of the system that captures and documents it and tries to do something with that during and after the event

### elements of scrollytelling

a model: you have a database that involves arrays of connections between things. You reveal these things, frequently in a paired system to the user. The user manipulates (usually) one of these things (through scrolling, say) to drive changes in the other.

- RELATIONS BETWEEN THINGS . . . (backed by a database, a system of ideas) collections of or relations between two or more things (the mise-en-scene?). These are the pairs of things that users see continuously while scrolling through a story.
    - image + text
    - text + text
    - x-axis plot + media/text
    - xy plot or map + media/text
    - video + text
    - data and analysis/explanation
    - process and description
- USER MOVES . . . ways of interacting with a thing, mechanics and moves on that thing (and these can drive narrative)
    - sliding comparison of images
    - zooming
    - analyzing
    - non-quantized, open-ended
        - zooming
        - side-scrolling through x-axis
        - scrolling through y-axis (frequently through text)
        - scrolling across x and y
- CHANGES TO THE VIEW . . . steps/movements that are triggered/driven by mechanics in one thing (often with one, or through one in connection to the other thing)
    - non-quantized, continuous
    - quantized, sometimes discontinuous
        - animate to new spot in x
        - animate to new spot in y
        - animate to new spot in x/y
        - zoom to new spot
        - image to image
            - fade
            - wipe
            - animate in/out
- GENRES AND FORMS
    - on one image, zooming around that image investigating it
    - text, accompanied by images
    - 
- (don't forget) COOL THINGS THAT HAPPEN WITHIN EACH THING. Each thing in isolation (a video, a text, etc) is complex, as we all know because we look at these things all the time :)
    - are all the cool things that always already happen in things (like texts, maps, etc)--much is going on here!


### notes
one unfortunate discovery: it's not possible to make a group on arcgis... or is it??

the group started to work on a doc that will overview best and worst practices for scrollytelling; thinking about classroom applications

drawing onto an image - as a way to call out detail or do some kind of an annotation


timeline js: can help give a sense of progression, need to be concise; limitation - only one image per slide -- also, focusing on the temporal progression can restrict the ability to orient in space (unless the map (eg) were also visible on the same page)

displaying students' work - what does scrollytelling enable in this zone?
multimodal data for students working with datasets

arcGIS: can find a lot of data online; backend is usually excel coordinates; you can set keyframes!

Carly worked a bit in storymaps to make a scroll that showed a contemporary image of widener turning into a historical blueprint

Yue found an example of a "scrolling" website but it's not *really* scrolling--it's actually more a static website

Shanni - interested in how to manage data that might go into a scroll; what kind of story to tell from the data

What is the story you want to tell and what sort of analysis do we want students to do?

Want to be intentional about when text and image are showing and what they're relationships are like to each other - sometimes it's almost like the image functions as background (or the text is like this)

difference between scrollytelling and hypertextual model of reading

### next steps:
* integrating some media assets to try in a couple of different platforms
* starting to make a list of best and worst scroll practices (on the way to a resource guide)
* get together a pop-up workshop on coding of some kind! 


## 20220923

Elitza made a scrollytelling prototype in cargo collective!
one drawback was that this platform doesn't let you share so Carly suggested doing a screen recording of it as one workaround

Anna was doing coding! The duck turns into a snail!
Stored on her github 

Resources to create:
* elements of academic scrollytelling
* lookbook of scrollytelling platform options (already underway)

### next steps
start to develop a scrollytelling story about Widener or Houghton:
* gather assets
    * text (Anna) + trying to do some annotation
    * timeline (Yue)
    * sound (Elitza)
    * photos (Andreja)
    * Yue will look at assets she has through HAA
    * news reports/logs (Shanni)
    * maps (Carly)
