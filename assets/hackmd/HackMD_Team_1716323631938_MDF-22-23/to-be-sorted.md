### accessing another machine's locally-running web-app

>Yes, you should be able to access your Next.js app running on your Mac from a different Mac on the same local network. To do so, you will need to find the IP address of your Mac running the Next.js app, and then use that IP address to access the app from the other Mac.
>
> Here are the steps you can follow:
> 
> Find the IP address of your Mac running the Next.js app. You can do this by opening the Terminal app on your Mac and entering the command "ifconfig" (without the quotes). Look for the "en0" section and find the "inet" value, which should be the IP address of your Mac.
> 
> On the other Mac, open a web browser and enter the IP address of your Mac, followed by ":3000" (without the quotes). For example, if your Mac's IP address is 192.168.1.10, you would enter "http://192.168.1.10:3000" into the web browser.

> If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to access your Next.js app from the other Mac. Note that some firewalls or network settings may prevent this, so you may need to adjust those settings to allow access.
