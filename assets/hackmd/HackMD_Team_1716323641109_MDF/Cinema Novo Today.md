# Cinema Novo Today

During a workshop the problem: 

![zoom effect illustration from The Office](https://media.giphy.com/media/9Fticsj7froxbpd5Sg/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47ud31gzegxuvaxt1lcj4a0bkvlnftrr9tej8p20ag&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)

The zoom doesn't have the same set of connotations as it once did (as in the era of *Cinema Novo*). The students report that it reminds them of The Office and other mockumentary-style pieces.

Now we need a rationale for why it's OK to teach students to TikTok in a PORT40 class :)

The learning objective is for students to achieve the *aims* of *Cinema Novo* using the filmic grammar of the *present*. So rather than robotically repeating each of the visual moves they find in the source texts, they are to find modern equivalents that achieve what we might term the "authenticity effects" achieved by Cinema Novo.
