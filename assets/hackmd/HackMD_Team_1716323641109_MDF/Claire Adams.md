Unlike in previous courses, they are having the students create a final poster to communicate research rather than a paper. They may need an example poster, help communicating the differences between writing argumentatively in essay format v. Conference posters etc.

The LL has scheduled a workshop for HIST1056 for three sections on Wednesday Oct 20 3:30 & Thursday Oct 21 at 10:30 and 2pm.

HIST99 - Ann Blair / Ian Miller
Featured projects for the department website, potentially interviews with students about their projects, adding abstracts to the Airtable. This is a continuation of summer project creating a database of student thesis projects. This can help the department attract concentrators and show current concentrators what types of projects are viable.
