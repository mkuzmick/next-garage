# Collaborative Scriptwriting: Three-Act Structure
One important element of devised theatre is that there is no one person to create the story. The story unfolds collaboratively. Sometimes these scripts hit a final, fixed version when a consensus is reached, and other times they end up taking the form of a strong structure for improv, including rules and clear goals to guide the story moving forward. These are the most common types of scripts that exist in our everyday encounters. The most successful ensembles (group of collaborators) work to establish shared vocabulary and understanding. They know each other and the content well enough to create improvised scenes on the spot.

The Three-Act Story Sructure can help groups find appropriate rhythms and markers of their story. For example, let's consider the story of a day at the Learning Lab! 

## The Beginning

Where do we start? What does the common scene look like? Perhaps Katie is typing away in her office, Jordan is found teaching HackMD to a new LLUF in the studio, Casey is setting up equipment for a shoot later this afternoon, and Marlon is taking a meeting in his office. Nothing out of the ordinary -- in fact the Begninning should often be exactly that -- the "ordinary" sounds, views, and smells to establish where we are and what we look like.

## Inciting Incident

Jessi arrives to the Learning Lab in a panic. She has developed an awesome workshop activity on "presence" in the classroom to try out during Theatre Lab today, but she completely forgot to write a script to work with! Being the only other people here today, Marlon, Jordan, Casey, and Katie spring into action to help Jessi.

The inciting incident is the first disturbance of the established situation. It gets our story moving. This doesn't always have to be a bad thing! It is simply anything that disrupts the established flow.
