# Eduarda Araujo
**Department:** AAAS
**Courses:** PORTUG40
**Labs:** illustrationLab, essayFilmLab, mapLab

* Eduarda's projects 
    * She is working on a course about Brazilian Cinema
        * Students have to work on making videos. Students have to write a critical essay about traditions in Brazilian Cinema, then illustrate and add VO to make it into an essay film.
        * For their final, students will be making a short film.
    * How to integrate visual art and video making with complex theories, a video project that's been in the works since 2014.

I will prepare four different workshops for students to explore visual elements of four traditions in Brazilian cinema, according to Professor Soares' syllabus: 
14/09 - Cinema Novo (1950s-1970s)
18/09 - Cinema da Retomada (1995-2000)
21/10 - Cinema da PÃ³s Retomada (2000s)
09/11 - Cinema in times of crisis (2016-today)

I still need to work on what each of these workshops will look like  - producing alternative movie posters, trailers, or photo essays. But the ideais for me to develop ways of teaching students how to understand, by practice, about the aesthetics of each of these periods. I think the main questions for me are: 
1. what will these visual explorations help students understand about Brazilian cinema and its contexts, that simply reading or talking about it could not? 
2. How can we find connections between the social, cultural and political issues these movies deal with, and students' realities in a place like Cambridge? A visual exploration of their surroundings inspired by the visual elements of Brazilian cinema could be helpful with this desired connection.

I will establish goals for each of these workshops, and will be able to share with the lab the following materials I will prepare:
- workshop detailed plans
- expositive materials I make in preparation to the workshops;
- students' works from each workshop

Other elements of this project include the following:
- Hackathons
- Two to three visits to the learning lab for an introduction, an opportunity to present their midterm projects. Perhaps some of the workshops could happen at the learning lab as well, with me tuning in remotely.
