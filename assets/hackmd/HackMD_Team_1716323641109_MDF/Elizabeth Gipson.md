# Elizabeth Gipson
**Department:** Celtic
**Courses:** Celtic101, GENED1081, Celtic188: Songs of the Highlander
**Labs:** essayFilmLab

## Elizabeth’s projects this summer/continuing into fall:

### Timelines
* Professor needed help with multiple individual timelines made
    * Analyzed PowerPoints and notes from previous iteration of the course to come up with a list of relevant dates for each class session. 
    * Created individual slides which will go in PowerPoint meetings for each class session, as well as on individual weekly pages on Canvas. 
    * Ex: ![](https://i.imgur.com/7alePmX.png)

    * If a better ChronoZoom alternative can't be found, these can 'stack' on a master timeline page so students are oriented throughout the entire run of the class


* ChronoZoom has been helpful in past, but it's been retired - looking for free options

    * Free options that have the same functionality are limited. I'm going to have a look again to see if I can find anything similar. Ideally we'd be hoping for something like the Timeline/Narrative view at the very bottom [here](https://timeline.app/gallery/ (paid product)). Professor has emphasized need to show not just weekly material covered, but how it fits into overall timeline.
    * ***If anyone knows of a better app, I am all ears!***
    
* Slides are easily editable if Professor needs a different focus each week.

### Storymapping project for a different class (class is in the spring!)
* waiting on the okay from the professor
* Drawing up the rubric, working up the canvas page, looking at placenames from text and deciding which to use
* tool: Storymaps
* Professor wants it done but it is unclear how many students there will be, and this likely will have an impact
* Once the professor says okay, wants to turn one or two over to the LLUFs to test
* LLUF TEST! Mission!! Try out the storymaps, see how they scale?
* **CURRENT: Awaiting course website availability. To be uploaded: Rubric, demo, resources page**

### Fall stuff:
* **Course websites revamped**:
    * Celtic 111, GenEd 1097, GenEd 1074
    * Created new front pages, custom weekly pages, graphics
    * Ex: ![](https://i.imgur.com/seDAFjM.png)

* **Fall course trailers:**
    * Celtic 111, FolkMyth111, Welsh 128, GenEd 1097, GenEd 1074
    * ***Is there a good way to link to these? Maybe I should put them unlisted on YouTube?***

* **Shapeshifters Class - Celtic 1111**
    * What if some of the written texts can be transformed?
    * Compiling resources/guides for students to take texts and create new retellings
    * Using art in the studio!
    * stop motion clay, visit to LL to launch final project.
    * Elizabeth asked about stock photos etc. There’s a lot of material in the public domain; students may be covered by Fair Use)
    * Dedicated meeting with Elizabeth and the professor to get a sense of what material would be valuable and talk through the project in more detail
* Patrick’s website as a storymap guide
    * storymap guide specifically for things you do in celtic
        * why you’d use that tool in this context-using an example really appropriate to your discipline
        * link to place names for celtic, here;s your bibliography
    * something to continue to be a resource, to be updated.

--> 
* **Landed on a StoryMap Project which included:**
    * Demo Storymap 
    * Class lecture/introduction to the tool
    * Trouble-shooting for students
    * See beautiful examples of student work for this project [here](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/ee6d36adb8574d8cbbb13e354ee47d92)!

### Project that was supposed to be in the summer but hasn’t started yet
* Pronunciation Guide Database-needed for spring
    * To try and lessen the distance between non-native speakers who sometimes won’t even try to pronounce names, places, things, etc.
    * Record native speakers
    * Could be filtered to seeing what’s relevant for specific classes
    * Marlon proposed to record video, not just audio, if we can make the scheduling work
        * Seeing someone’s lips move is so important
        * Can use really high quality microphones in the studio with a closeup of the person talking
        * For the faculty person who may not be able to come to campus, we can send them gear for recording
        * Elizabeth can reach to Katie will book time in the studio, and Elizabeth can be there to direct
        * Can wait till delta dies down

## Celtic 188: Songs of the Highlander
The end goal will be to help the students produce a podcast which will serve as their final project. Along the way I anticipate the need to help develop the prompt itself as well as resource pages specific to sourcing audio materials for the Scots Gaelic song tradition.

This is a very small class (one undergrad, one grad) for which Tasha would like to offer the option of doing a podcast project rather than a final research paper. A podcast seems like a natural fit given that the course material is largely focused on a song tradition and it opens up different ways of engaging with the material rather than just describing it in writing. 

In terms of hours required, work is mainly focused on the building of the task and rubric, research on similar 'bite-sized' podcasts which might be useful for students, and, (perhaps most importantly) some studio time for recording. There probably wouldn't have to be a huge amount of time set aside for this given that the class is tiny.

Studio time for students who choose to do the podcast rather than a paper (one student is definitely on board, the other may come on board) would be amazing.

* Project went ahead - very, very small seminar though. Only one student went with podcast option. I'll see if I can get instructor permission to share final rubric and perhaps student work.

**tl;dr - Completed for Fall Semester:**
* Custom course websites: Celtic 111, GenEd 1097, GenEd 1074
* Course trailers: Celtic 111, FolkMyth111, Welsh 128, GenEd1097, GenEd 1074
* Celtic 111: StoryMaps assignment (demo, lecture, troubleshooting for students)
* Celtic 188: Podcast project


**Desiderata for future projects:**

- As mentioned above, any leads on a tool similar to the old ChronoZoom (or the paid app Aeon) would be wonderful!

**Looking ahead:**

- Course websites/trailers have already been requested for Spring, so those will go up first (Included here is uploading timelines to individual course pages, as well as creating a 'master timeline' section for GenEd 1081)
- StoryMap for Saga needs uploading once course website is available
- Will try to get up a 'rough and tumble' demo of the pronunciation website so that Spring classes can make use of it
- Once these deadlines are met, full steam ahead into the bigger pronunciation database.
- **Update**: Requests for GenEd 1081 [here](https://hackmd.io/@elizabethg/SJ8J7IpKK).

**Maybe?**
- Perhaps a geotagged HarvardLore website for GenEd 1097?  Still in conversations with professor about this.
