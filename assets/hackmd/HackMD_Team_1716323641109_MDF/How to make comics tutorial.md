here I will add some text to explain what's happening in that strip


# Building character

1. Start from sketch
Start with basic shapes: circle, box, triangle.
It makes the chracter look three dimensional and consistent.
2. Draw a model sheet. 
A model sheet shows a single chracter in multiple positions: 1. standing position, facing you; 2. three-quarters position; 3. the profile (the hardest). Use guidelines at key points of the anatomy, top of the head, the eyes, the chin, the hands and bottom of the feet.
