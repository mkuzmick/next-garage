# ILLUSTRATING IDEAS: THE STORY SO FAR

*let's collaborate on a doc that sums up the work of this Cluster. Our excuse for doing this will be Christine's arrival (so we can help get her up to speed!) . . . but this doc will have many many uses, and will be an example of the sort of simple markdown-report that we'll end up creating for each of the MDFs as individuals too!*

In MCB80, students are encountering scientific papers for the first time. Every semester MCB 80 will cover several classical research papers that are important milestones in the field of neuroscience. MCB80 has a focus on science communication broadly, and professor Jeff Lichtman wants to create several graphic abstracts of classical papers in the field of neurobiology to show students how scientific research generates knowledge. We hope to make these graphic abstracts as straightforward demonstrations to show students how original research was conducted, and help them gain a better understanding of important findings and techniques.
