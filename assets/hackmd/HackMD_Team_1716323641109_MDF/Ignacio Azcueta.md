# Ignacio Azcueta
**Department:** RLL
**Courses:** Spanish50

## Projects

### Spanish 50 Podcasting
* My first project is the implementation of a podcasting task in the course I am TF'ing (Spanish 50 - Creative Writing and Performance. Course head: Adriana Gutiérrez). My goal for this course is to help students better engage with audio materials while also learning more about audio processing software in the process.
* This project is complete for Fall 2021, but Ignacio may repeat it in the spring.

### Future Thinking Workshop series
 * My other project is the "Future Thinking" series. Together with Nicole Mills (Senior Preceptor in Romance Languages and Literatures) we are designing a series of conversations on the future of teaching. The end-product of this project is, on one hand, to hold a series of conversations around urgent topics in teaching: the future of interaction, the future of translation, the future of the textbook, and the future of the classroom. On the other, to produce out of these conversations short clips to upload at the RLL Facebook page.
 * As of 11/24, 2 of 4 Workshops have been completed; clips still work in progress. Ignacio plans to edit and publish the Fall portion of the Future Thinking clips by the end of the fall term.

### Latinx Podcast Initiative
* María Luisa Parra-Velasco, (Senior Preceptor in Spanish) holds a Spanish class for heritage speakers. She would like to help students from hispanic background to create a podcast. I've presented her some ideas but I have still to hear from her.
* As of 11/24, Ignacio is in conversation with Maria Luisa about formatting and funding. He hopes to continue developing the idea with María Luisa Parra.

### Dissertation
 * The other I have been thinking concerns my dissertation. I would also like to consider the possibility of transforming either a part of my first or second chapter of my dissertation into a video essay.

### Spring 2022 Plans
* I will develop assignments with the course I will teach, it will be either Spanish 50, Spanish 61, or a course at VES.
* I will work with RLL faculty in the Future Thinking series.
* I will teach a podcast workshop in Spanish 50 if needed.
* Depending on the status of my dissertation chapters, see if I can work some of the skills I am learning in the Learning Lab into it.
* Note: Ignacio's appointment at VES has to be confirmed, but he expects to be the TF of a film studies class on Chilean cinema in Spring 2022, taught by Dominga Sotomayor -a Chilean film director- and Haden Guest -Harvard Film Archive director. If this is confirmed, in the Spring he hopes to further the synergy between my teaching and the Learning Lab.
