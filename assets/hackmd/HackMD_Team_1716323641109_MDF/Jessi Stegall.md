## Projects in Progress
The following projects are in progress, either yet to be completed by me or have not yet been introduced during TheatreLab time:

[Collaborative Scriptwriting](https://hackmd.io/@theatre-lab/r1iN07CfY)
[Theatre & Masks](https://hackmd.io/@theatre-lab/HkEAk3kQt)
[Developing Presence](https://hackmd.io/@theatre-lab/SJ2smNRfY)
[Performing an Academic Paper](https://hackmd.io/@theatre-lab/Skw3ZbuvY)

By the end of this term, I'd like to:
* Find a way to implement some of the tools we've developed in TheatreLab into workshops for courses coming into the Learning Lab
* Schedule studio time for LLUFs, MDFs, and LL staff to design & create some of the Moves of Immersion Proposals we developed during the Moves of Immersion workshop. I'd love to have some of them ready to implement by the start of next term. 
* I'd also like to find a way to get other LLUFs to participate in the moves of immersion study. How can this act as an asynchronous study for all LLUFs? If we had more LLUFs propose ideas, it could make the studio time that much more meaningful. 
* Transfer some of the work I've been doing this semester into a designed process book and/or guidebook for implementing theatre tools into our everyday learning experiences. I can see taking particular themes (gesture, voice, scriptwriting, blocking) into chapters. Perhaps doing this on InDesign?
* I'd like to come up with a plan for framing theatre lab for next term. Perhaps this means changing the name to something less intimidating like "event lab," "performance lab" or "immersion lab."
* I am thinking about bringing back the gesture work we started at the beginning of the semester, particular the "signature gesture" activity as a tool to form an embodied understanding of a particular project or subject. Perhaps this can be part of "performing an academic paper." What would it mean to create a series of gestures to tell the story of an essay? 









* Jessi's work in theatreLab is definitely feeding ideas into Cluster 2
    * Eduarda is curious to learn this material!
    * Turning your essay in a script, writing stage directions - how you adapt a novel into a play or movie.
    * Wants to create a video essay for her capstone presentation.
    * Using story arcs / story shapes.

Last week Jessi launched **theatreLab**. She led Marlon, Jordan and Abby through an array of activities intended to expand our gestural vocabularies. In these gifs you can see us performing an improv activity in which each performer needs to enter the stage with a gesture that contrasts markedly with the performer already on stage.
