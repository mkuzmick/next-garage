# Juhee Kang
**Department:** EALC
**Project:** Tools for Digital Scholarship - Shigehisa Kuriyama

Tools for Digital Scholarship (website) intends to provide scholars in humanities with ready-to-use research and presentation techniques. The project will facilitate the process of better communicating some of the previously developed ideas on the site and aim to increase the site visibility. 
I will:
1. Reorganize/reformat the website: toolsfordigitalscholarship.com
2. Rework on the videos and scripts
3. Add resources found in the meantime
