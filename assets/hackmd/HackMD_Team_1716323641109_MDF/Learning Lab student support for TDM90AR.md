# Learning Lab student support for TDM90AR

At the [Bok Center for Teaching and Learning](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/home), the **[Learning Lab](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/learning-lab)** (pictured below) is  an intergenerational team and a studio space built to support creative approaches to teaching and learning.

[Jessi Stegall](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/people/jessi-stegall) is a Media & Design Fellow at the Learning Lab working with TDM courses & students to develop their media & design skills for TDM courses & assignments.

### Time-capsuled interviews

Using documentary-style interviews, students will be given the opportunity to document changes in their learning, opinions, and goals throughout a course or project. Much like the Vanity Fair Billie Eilish time-capsuled interviews, these interviews will be edited together to show how student thinking around the course and their artistry has evolved over time.

Students who are interested can reach out to the learning lab and book a slot to come and film their initial interview. 


### Visualizing your track

As we know each student in TDM90DR will produce a track for a final assignment, students who are interested in documenting & visualizing their track can utilize the Learning Lab studio resources to create video-essay style outputs for their track.

### Editing rehearsal & performance footage 
    
Throughout the semester, the Learning Lab will be collecting rehearsal and performance footage for TDM90AR. We will create a google drive folder for you all to access the footage and contribute your own photos/videos taken throughout the process as well. For those that would like to edit the footage into a promotional reel or social media post, Jessi can offer sessions to learn basic video editing skills.

### Paper prototyping
    
If you'd ever like to experiment with some of your pupptry ideas  with miniature prototypes, the learning lab has the resources and space for you to use paper, clay, etc. to build miniatures of your ideas.
