        * 

#### collective project?
- a resourceBase for ways of visualizing data and visualization?
- compare and contrast tools for mapping and datavis and telling datastories, beginner AR 
    - would this maybe be "the basics?"
- what types are there beyond the basic quantitative tables and graphs that students are used to already
    - would this be "beyond the basics" then?
    - what are the OTHER possibilities?
    - to represent quantitative data in a research context
    - spatial representation of data
- interacting with data, seeing in many ways
- how to visualize narrative
    - interested in annotations?


### GROUP 2 NOTES
* Jessi's work in theatreLab is definitely feeding ideas into Cluster 2
    * Eduarda is curious to learn this material!

        * For their final, students will be making a short film.
    * How to integrate visual art and video making with complex theories, a video project that's been in the works since 2014.
* Other projects in this realm:
    * Wesley - The Essay Film in AFVS, The Art of Film course with Laura Frahm

##### the people
* Queenie. 
* Xiaomeng. writer for Science in the News blog + creates illustration for her pieces.

##### the tools
* **procreate**. for general audience, easy to use
* **illustrator**. more professional for a scientific community. uses vectors, not drawing.
* **photoshop**. 
* **fresco**.
* **ipad**. for drawing directly
* **lap top**. more memory than ipad
* **wacom.** drawing pad
* **clipstudio.** drawing software similar to photoshop

##### the projects
* graphical abstracts for faculty/researchers
* explainer graphics for courses
* graphical abstract assignments for students
* explainer video assignments for students
* explainer animation (Ae) for courses

##### challenges
you need to understand the material REALLY WELL before you can successfully illustrate it.

##### the process/method
begin by collecting references/models. create a draft that has more info and then you can work on simplifying more and more. use layers to reiterate.

**We want a place to agregate the work that's being done in this area to avoid duplication of work.**
