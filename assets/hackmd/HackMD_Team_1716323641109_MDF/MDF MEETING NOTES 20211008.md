### Updates on New Projects for Courses & Depts

#### GENED1091: Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Theory, Professor Michael Puett
In this class, students are prompted to rethink their lives and the world around them by taking classical Chinese theory seriously. Enrollment is around 260 students, it's one of the iconic GENED courses. The final project is an open-ended creative project where students are prompted to rethink elements of the world/society according to the themes of the course. Some examples are healthcare, office space, etc. Students are encouraged to add creative elements to their final projects.

Some of the ideas we explored during our meeting:
* Could ask that students adhere to a structure for the reflection piece:
    * A description of the thing, media of the thing, a rationale of that thing.
* Workshops on the common shapes the project takes
    * Can show 3-4 examples to nudge them into models that could be fruitful, could include examples of what the rationale might look like for the various mediums.
* Recording any physical final projects in the Learning Lab studio
    * Can book a day or a few hours where students can come and be recorded.
* Can offer a hackathon time to support any students working on creative projects.
* Get students to do a taster of the creative moves in section. 
    * “Capture a video that reflects this idea”
    * With Juhee’s help we could come up with 4-5 of these 5 minute scaffolding assignments to deploy in section.
    * Juhee would like to think through the logistics. Make sure that it happens in the footprint of the section.
    * Make sure that the content of the activity matches the theme of the reading for that week so that it doesn’t lead TFs astray.
* They’d love the ramp up the website that they created last year to archive student projects. 
    * Getting permission from the students to make them public. Record director’s commentaries with students in spring.
* Building a database of all the lesson plans, activity materials, writing samples, etc. Could roll this out to the rest of the department. This has been a pain point for the course before...handing off materials from one head TF to another. Could also consider publishing elements of this on the public website.
