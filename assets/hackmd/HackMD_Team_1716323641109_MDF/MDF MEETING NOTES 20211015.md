# MDF MEETING NOTES 20211015

completely virtual! (and next week will be in person)

## AGENDA

###  The Clusters --> Labs!
Last week all the clusters met for the first time and started to define their goals for the term. This week we had a bit of a wrench thrown into our physical space with the AC in the building breaking. So Time Cluster (aka time-talk-lab) and Illustration-Animation-Imagination Cluster (aka imagination-lab) were postponed to next week.

#### [data-space-lab](https://hackmd.io/mbpQ2nfQQoyj6EvYRHB6OQ):  Tuesday 4-5pm
![zane's map](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F02HJPVRGR0/image.png?pub_secret=defd4b8e39)
**who was there**: Zane, Queenie, Kangni, Tica, Marlon, Claire, Ammara, and Sophie
**what we did:** Zane led us through a Mapbox tutorial.
**what's next?**: let's think of ways to deploy mapbox and some next tools to learn.

**things we learned**
* prepping the dataset (and uploading it) in advance helps!
* once the data was in, things went really quickly
* maybe Data Wrapper next!
* 

#### [time-talk-lab](https://hackmd.io/6ShbJe_0Tn-8JjWsrm5ndw) : (Moved to Next Thursday 4-5pm)

#### [imagination-lab](https://hackmd.io/lnyLuNtNSNWF9C4JFvYqwQ) : (Moved to Next Monday 11am)

###  Updates on New Projects for Courses & Depts



### IDEAS FOR JORDAN

* Harvard Lore
    * One of the semester-long projects in GenEd 1097 (aka 'Tradition, Performance, and Culture' aka 'Intro to Folklore') is the compilation of a set of items of "HarvardLore". Each student is responsible for documenting fifteen items, which can be Harvard-centric superstitions, legends, jokes, rituals, etc. Students are encouraged to approach anyone who might be the holder of such knowledge - fellow students, d-hall workers, building managers, Deans, department admins - anyone - to get items for their collections. 
    * We were brainstorming over the summer a bit and thought it could be intriguing to show off some of these items on a dedicated website. With student permission, we could overlay the items on a map of Harvard's campus, and so create a sort of "tour" of HarvardLore. While they aren't required to collect images, geo-tagged images would be especially helpful for a site like this.
    * A LOT of the items we get are very building specific, and I'd imagine there's a good chance the LLUFs will have already know a lot of the stories we're collecting. To start off, here are some buildings or landmarks which come up frequently:
        * Johnston Gate
        * The John Harvard statue
        * Widener
        * River Houses (for the River Run)
        * Holden Chapel
        * Dunster House (usually related to its ghost)
        * But ANY location can be rich in local traditions
    * NB: I know Lowell Brower, also in folklore, has been leading spooky campus tours for his currently running course "Supernatural Storytelling: Ghost-lore, Occult Legends, and the Politics of the Paranormal" - long term he might also like something like this!
    
* Architectural History
    * document building elements that document a specific era
    * split map view, one of harvard campus, and if you click on the data point/location, a global map on the right lights up with origination of style(s) found in the harvard building? 
    * react/coding lab - architecture texture guessing game
