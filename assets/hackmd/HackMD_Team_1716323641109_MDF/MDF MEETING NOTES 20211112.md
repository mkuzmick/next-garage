## SHOW + TELL
### Kangni
![Kangni and her database](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F02LQTS891V/screen_shot_2021-11-12_at_10.39.10_am.png?pub_secret=fc1b175fa5)
Kangni is working on creating a searchable database where students and professors can search for illustrations in pre-modern chinese literature.

Illustrations are generally regarded as less important than paintings, so they are a bit harder to find.

Kangni is using Airtable to organize and store the data. She is trying to optimize the records to make them searchable for students. She's also annotating the images in Airtable using the Image Markup block and the comments feature in Airtable. (She's finding the comments feature a bit easier to navigate than the block.)

Kangni is starting to think about how to develop tags that, for instance, note the themes of the illustrations, characters that appear in multiple illustrations, and chapters that have been illustrated by multiple artists. One idea was to involve students in the process of coming up with and/or assigning tags to the illustrations. Could there be a project or assignment that asks students to do this? It might be interesting for students to discuss the different tags that could apply to a single illustration or a group of illustrations.

Ideas for Kangni:
* You can use a multiselect field to add tags!
* Create a table of artists or texts to use it as a linked field so that you don't need to type their names over and over again.
* It would be cool to make a script that let us store the Image annotations/comments within the base, instead of on Airtable's servers (where we can lose them...ðŸ˜¬).
