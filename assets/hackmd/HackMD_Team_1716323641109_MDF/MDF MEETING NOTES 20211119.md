## SHOW AND TELL

### Juhee

* [Maps in Humanities](https://airtable.com/shr8yHjwRxKrJkkYH/tbloep99y8n62fUQy) (linked to a course in EALC - Modern Korean Literature), using Airtable gallery to use URL as a reference point for their assignments, courses.

What data it includes: image, description of the project, classified by department, access URL, visualization source; Juhee is interested in potentially adding in section table where students can see tool you might need to use if you were doing one of these assignments.

* GENED1091: Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Theory TF Resource Website (internally-facing / not open to the public)
    * [Gen Ed Writes: Writing Across the Disciplines at Harvard College](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/genedwrites/home). This is the inspiration for GENED1091 website that Juhee is working on.
    * [Gov website another inspiration](https://govteaches.fas.harvard.edu/improve-your-teaching-resources)

What data it includes: name of philosopher (because lectures in thhe course are organized around philosophers), lesson plans as PDF attachments, first slide has questions professor distributes to the students; resources for TFs - both useful for a TF before and during teaching

Because this is a GENED course, students often need support understanding basic components of academic essay writing. So, this Airtable would also include PDFs and resources for students writing essays. This also might have examples of exemplary, problematic, etc., essays, which include descriptions that explain why certain essays were categorized in a particular way. This would aim to help TFs during grading/evaluation, providing them with some context about why an essay was evaluated in a particular way.

**Possible next steps**: "What to do" scenarios - Juhee mentioned the possibility of creating a flashcard style layout where TFs can click to see what to do if a student hasn't been attending section (e.g., contact the professor). Queenie wondered about the possibility of creating a survey to figure out how many students in the course are majors versus taking it for a GENED requirement, tracking enrollments, etc.

Juhee would love help turning her Airtables into a website! And would it be possible to have former and current EALCs or other TFs come to LL to give Juhee feedback on this database?

Jessi is curious if Juhee would be interested in using this information as curriuculum for a TF orientation for this course. Potential collaboration with TheatreLab to create an event for TFs out of this in the spring?

Airtable

### Queenie

[Creating a website for Prof. Puett's course - GENED1091](https://gened-1091.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/index.html) (the other website associated with this course; Juhee's is the other)

This website allows current students to view former students' creative projects and their write ups about them. It also includes a course overview that contains a WordCloud with course readings and topics. There's another page that Queenie wants to keep developing that traces the frequency and distribution of the topics you might explore in the course. This is currently sorted by terms that occur in the readings. Queenie also wants to add a video of the professor introducing the course, the central figures and ideas, and how it's important and related to the world today. The audience for this website is students who might be "shopping" for courses or thinking about taking the class.

Does LL offer any cloud storage? This is a question for MK! :)
