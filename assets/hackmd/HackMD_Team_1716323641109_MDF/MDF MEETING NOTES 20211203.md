# MDF MEETING NOTES 20211203

in person!

## AGENDA
1. Updates
2. Midterm Surveys
3. Spring Plans


## UPDATES
* All MDF meetings will take place in person from now on
* **Today is our last meeting for the fall term**
* Please fill out your [midterm surveys](https://airtable.com/shrWzGIoX1jbzk0bM) if you have not done so already. 
* Please let Christine know if you have any questions about any of the above (or anything else)! Looking forward to discussing your awesome projects at our check-ins (scheduling via Slack with Katie)!

## Midterm Surveys
Using your mid-term surveys, Christine has been putting together short reports about each of your projects, some [drafts of which can be seen here](/qUxkSat_TaOo-snfsoDmbA). In the new year (ideally in January), Marlon and Christine will arrange meetings with your departments to share with them the amazing work you've been doing as an MDF or Bok Fellow! 

Please send Christine images or any additional text you'd like included in your reports! If you have any information about your spring projects, including projects linked to specific courses, please send those to Christine in your individual Slack channel.

## Spring Projects + J-term Projects
Looking ahead to the spring, what are some of the projects or tools that you're excited about? How can we help you get ready for the spring? 

We're excited to hold some tutorials about the tools you're excited to learn--let us know!

Would anyone like assistance finding spring projects?

J-Term Projects/Prototypes: Over the months of **December/January**, we'll be doing some internal projects that develop prototypes for course assignments and the like. Can you think of any project in this zone that might be exciting for you to work on with our support/in working groups?

Example: [Comic Book Spread Prototype](/D27SUVILRPiuLeeAv0OD7Q) from Illustrating Ideas Cluster

### Activity
Using the cards on the table, write down:

Yellow card: your name
Pink card: Projects for courses or your department (just list the course name if you're offering general support)
Blue card: Tools and forms you'd like to learn or that your department might want you to learn! :)

Let's take a look at what we came up with and think about possible working groups that oculd emerge from our overlaps.
