# MDF MEETING NOTES 20220128

on Zoom!

## AGENDA
1. Updates
2. Spring Term Plans
3. Activity!


## UPDATES
* All MDF meetings will take place in person from now on, Harvard's Covid guidelines permitting. 
* The required meetings this term will be held **every other Friday** (so, our next required meeting is Friday, Feb. 11 at the LL studio)
    * In the "off weeks" in between these meetings: we will use the Friday meeting time (10:30 - 11:45 am) as designLabs, where we develop a prototype for a course or professor who has asked us for something. At these workshops, you'll have the chance to team up with other MDFs, LL staff, and Learning Lab Undergraduate Fellows to create awesome things.
    * The first of these, on **Friday, Feb. 4**, will be on Process Filmmaking--please join us if you can!

## This Term

**Harvard Horizons** 
One of the major initiatives the LL supports each spring is Harvard Horizons. We help the Horizon scholars prepare for their presentations throughout the term. Please reach out if you are interested in helping with this! In the past, MDFs have helped create [graphics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CufZCPkEDGQ), animations, and other materials that Horizon scholars use in their presentations. Please reach out to Christine if you'd like to help out with this!

**Protocols for Show-Your-Work and Show-and-Tell**
Building on the Show and Tell work you did throughout the fall term, we have developed a workflow around sharing work-in-progress with one another on a regular basis. **Please [read about the plan for Show-Your Work](/wY0TXtMuSwuw0mwRNBJYaA) and start posting images to the show-your-work Slack as soon as possible!** 

At the bottom of this page is a **timeline** of images that have recently been sent to the show-your-work Slack channel!

**Labs**
This term, we're going to organize labs around the different prototypes we're developing for courses and departments. **If you think of or hear about a need for an assignment or activity we could prototype, please let us know!**

We're developing a menu of current prototypes, workshops, and resources, and once it's complete, Christine will share it with you. We will  publicize other prototypes, workshops, etc. as they come up throughout the term.

## Activity
**PART ONE!**
In breakout rooms, think with your group about how a photo can tell a story. For example, if you wanted to tell a story about your workspace, how would do that in an image? Could you tell the story of your workspace with an extreme close-up? How and why would you do that? Alternatively, if you wanted to capture your entire workspace, how would you make strategic choices about framing to guide your viewer's attention to particular details, objects, etc.? 

**Brainstorm as a group all of the ways (as many as you possibly can!) to visually show what you're working on!** Feel free to use this doc to write down your notes and inspirations!


Let's make a list here!!
* screenshots (possible tool: Moom)
    * layer them so you can see multiple windows, a workflow
* adding visualizations where there aren't any - charts, graphics, text overlay
* showing before/after of something; showing change that has occurred
    * using two screens/monitors/app windows to add contrast/before/after/change
* blueprints of the space that I'm in
* flow-chart-like mapping of the progress I'm making
* timeline of my work
* drawing of my workspace
* highlighting contrast
* when is text "object-y" (when is my textual work like an illuminated medieval manuscript?)
* comic books
* data vis
* point-of-view from an object in your workspace (how would my notebook see me writing/brainstorming)
* collage
* gif? 
* using color, tone, annotations to bring attention to particular details



**PART TWO!**
Using your phone or the screenshot function, take three pictures of whatever you're currently working on. How would you explain using images your projects and things you're excited about working on right now? Can you tell a story about what you're currently working on, using only pictures?


Choose two approaches from the list above to test out. Post to the #show-your-work channel. 

Come back together and let's compare which approach communicated the story of what you are working on more effectively and why!
