# MDF MEETING NOTES 20220211

in person at the LL studio!

## AGENDA
1. Updates
2. Timeline Activity


## UPDATES
**Spring Labs**:
* cineLab
* realityLab
* graphicsLab
* codeLab
* audioLab
* eventLab
* *essentialsLab*

These labs are organized around the fundamental tools and moves that the LL uses across courses, workshops, projects, and in other activities. Because this term has been somewhat complex given schedules and Covid, we're going to plan biweekly labs. These labs will be held synchronously and asynchronously throughout the term. Synchronous tutorials and activities will be held at the LL studio, whereas asynchronous work (like the ARCGis tutorial I Slacked to our main MDF channel last week) can be completed any time. Whether the lab work is synchronous or asynchronous during a given week, please be sure to share your progress in **show-your-work** and document it in your HackMD. This is a great way for us to share what we're learning with each other and preserve all of the amazing stuff you all know so that future learners can benefit!

Throughout the term, we'll post announcements about tutorials, pop-up workshops, and other lab-related stuff in the lab-specific Slack channels. Please join the channel for the labs you're most excited to join if you aren't already a member of it!

**CALL FOR TUTORIAL LEADERS!**
With these labs in mind, are there tools (e.g., Final Cut, Blender, Audition, so forth) you'd like to offer a tutorial in, practicing teaching it to LL staff, other MDFs, and LLUFs? If so, please let Christine know--we would love to have you practicing teaching using the tools you know *or* want to learn enough to teach!
