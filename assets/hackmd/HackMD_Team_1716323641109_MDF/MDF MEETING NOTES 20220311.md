## Multimodal activity design challenge

**Part I: Brainstorming with Cards!**

Many of you have spent this past year designing multimodal capstone assignments and activities for Harvard courses. 

Let's use the cards to write down what some of these assignments were, so we have a collective list of the possibilities that multimodal communication and analysis affords. Try to think generally, too, about what types of multimodal assignments work well (or might work well) in your home department or program.

**Part II: Scaffolding Activity Design Challenge!**

Now, let's think a bit about the steps involved in learning to make one of these multimodal capstones, both because you've learned the skills yourselves this year, and because you may have encountered some of the various obstacles and troubles that students encounter in classes when they're trying out these new media for the first time.

**Let's come up with some "scaffolding" activities that students in your departments/courses might need to do on the way to one of these multimodal assignments.** These activities might be a little bit too late to implement this year, but it would be awesome to share these ideas with each other today (and they're great resources for incoming MDFs!). 

So, your challenge today is to think about: What kind of scaffolding activity did you/would you design to get students excited about working in a particular tool that might be unfamiliar to them? What would students do during this activity, and why do you think it would work especially well in your department/program/imagined course?

In 30 minutes, try to:
* Determine the media/tool you'd want students to use. Write this down on a card or a sheet of colored paper.
* Design a class-length (i.e., one hour) activity for students, that gets them thinking about the assignment and the tool they need to use to complete it. Try to represent the steps of this activity on cards or colored paper, noting what students should do and in what order.
* Write 1 short paragraph that can serve as a prompt for your imagined students - the more concise, the better!

You can be as low- or high-tech as you'd like! Feel free to use art supplies and whatever else is at your disposal in the LL studio!
