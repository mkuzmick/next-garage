# MDF MEETING NOTES 20220324

in person in the LL classroom (to the right of the front desk)

## AGENDA
1. Updates
2. Show Your Work
3. Key Terms for Teaching and Learning Activity!

## UPDATES
We're going to continue wearing masks at our MDF meetings and will keep track of case counts in the meantime. 

Does anyone have any updates? Any workshops that you're planning to host for your department? Let Christine know!

Jessi would love any help with HDP and the documentary she's making for this dance course. If you'd like to help out, send Christine a Slack!

## SHOW YOUR WORK

## KEY TERMS FOR TEACHING AND LEARNING
At the LL, we have hopes of one day (soon!) creating an "LL Glossary" of key terms related to the work that we all do here. This glossary will help us preserve the ideas that inform our teaching and learning practices. 

We talk a lot about "tools" in terms of things like Photoshop or Blender--the tools we use to make awesome things!--but today we'll think about the conceptual and theoretical tools that guide or structure our work.

Our activity today is going to be one step toward building an LL glossary. It will take the form of an installation of annotated texts that will be displayed in our LL studio space. 

For those of you who intend to continue teaching (and learning!) after your time at Harvard, this exercise might help you think through some of the key concepts that inform your pedadogical practice; in this sense, this exercise might help you think about your teaching philosophy.

**What we'll do:**

**Part 1**

* Spend 5-7 minutes **listing on square cards the key terms that have shaped your experiences, goals, projects, and so forth as a teacher, a learner, a scholar, or an artist**. What terms and concepts have been particularly inspiring for you? Where did you first, or most compellingly, encounter these ideas?

**Part 2**
* Team up with 2-3 other people to discuss any points of contact between the words you wrote down on cards. It might be cool, too, to see what points of difference emerge, or whether someone wrote down a term that's crucial to your own thinking and teaching but that you maybe forgot to include!
* We'll share our key terms with each other as a large group 
* Then, identify 1-2 of your favorite/most important terms, and make it into a tiny work of art on one of the circular cards (we can use these to make buttons, if there's time!)

**If there's time:**
* Try to find a **brief source passage** from any text that uses this term, showing us how it appears in context. (See examples on the white board for reference!)
* And if there's time, we'll make your favorite key terms into BUTTONS! This is why using the circular cards is a thing today :)

**Part 3 - next week, if you want to participate!**
* Send your source passage/paragraph to **Show-Your-Work on Slack** (we can also share a template that allows you to make a printed version of your key passage like we did - let Christine know if you want access to the template!)
* If you're around and excited about it, we'll print these source passages on both regular white 11 x 17 paper and on colored paper to make an installation in the LL studio, using the white boards!
