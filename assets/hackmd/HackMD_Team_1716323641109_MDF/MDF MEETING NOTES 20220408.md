# MDF MEETING NOTES 20220408

in person in the LL studio

## AGENDA
1. Updates
2. Show Your Work
3. Reflection Exercise

## UPDATES

This is our penultimate meeting! 

Christine is going to start reaching out to you individually on Slack, asking for some writing and media related to your projects this academic year. The more info and the more visuals you can provide, the better! This will be really helpful as the LL team puts together end of year reports. Please let Christine know if you have any questions about this.

JK attempts to take notes:
* Siriana and Chris ran an evening workshop for Music students. 3 students from Music in the 60s and Analyzing Pop Music. They have things built to run this over and over. We will log the courses and reach out to profs this summer. One of the profs emailed back and ased for more resources (this was Kate). We want to upsell them towards something more scaffolded. To design the assisgnment better. 
* Ana did 2 workshops for the same course: War & Peace. Creative assignment option for course. next time prof says she will require these sessions. Prof is excited about meeting about Russia's Gold Age in the Spring. Will work on creating those scaffolding pieces. Will culminate in Multimedia golden age of russia tour. by the time they need to do the final, they will have had an appetizer of all the different options. Siriana thinks she can do something similar for Music. Ana will share materials and ideas with her! Andrea also like the idea. we will crowd source and make this a fun collective project. ==A BANK OF TUTORIALS== we can all share and use! put together a little hackMD with little videos of us. even film us doing the mic tasting activity. Marlon likes this as a project-wants it as records in an airtable and to then populate a smooth scorlling website of collectios of them. ==101 BITE SIZED ACTIVITIES!== and we can get llufs to prototype any of these microtutorials.
* Emily SCRB111. Taking hot topics in stem cell bio. voice over with overhead displays of visuals. JK and Emily have been consulting with the student groups. generating ideas for visualizing something that we can't see in reality.

### Marlon launches our support for Harvard Horizons 2023!
This is really bg project for us. If anyone is excited about helping out with this project. We invite you to put togher a few little animations or stills that you;ve made for us to show the Horizoneers in January. We create assets that go into thier final keynotes. Things in blender, after effects, final cut, etc. 

could you imagine doing an event for grad students in your deptartmnet to help them communicate visually & orally like this. Sarah is already doing this!

Horizons stuff will be happening on. Fridays. We'd like to hep you design something for your departments. We will report on this too! We want to do more of this stuff!!

## REFLECTION EXERCISE

Given that this is one of our last Friday meetings, we thought it would be a good time to reflect on your work as an MDF. Let's also use this as an opportunity to create some awesome media about your MDF work!

Using the LL studio art supplies, take about 15 minutes to make a visual (or handful of visuals) that tells the story of your work as an MDF this year. Is there a way that you can combine both image and text in order to tell this story?

Things to reflect on could include:
* What courses did you support as an MDF? How did you provide support in these courses?
* What tools did you find to be the most useful given your interests, skills, and projects? 
* What would you tell an incoming MDF about this program? Can you imagine a single image (maybe an icon or a graphic or a single term?!) that captures what an MDF does? 

Be prepared to give a little micro-tour of your work as an MDF at the main studio table, presenting any visuals you make under the overhead camera.
