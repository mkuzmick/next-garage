# Media & Design Fellows Glossary

## Our Key Terms

1. Thinking routines: 
A thinking routine is a set of questions or a brief sequence of steps used to scaffold and support student thinking.
We can use a QR code to connect to the toolkit http://www.pz.harvard.edu/thinking-routines
Or use this text from David Perkins on the importance of making thinking visible http://www.pz.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/makingthinkingvisibleEL.pdf

2. Slow looking:
The practice of slow looking, pioneered by Shari Tishman at HGSE, can help us gain insights about our context that we might otherwise overlook or take for granted. Slow Looking tool can be used to build inquiry skills, document an innovation project, or collect data.
