**Challenges in Virtual ASL Class**
* Canvas does not allow for feedback on videos to be shared through video format (Meaning notes on ASL would be given in written English)
* The exam templates do not allow for multiple videos to be uploaded - requiring students to move between tabs to upload videos (which gets flagged in the cheating prevention tracking on canvas)
* Multiple choice questions are not compatible with allowing gifs/videos as answers 
* The legal requirements of accessibility being met does not always mean that the needs of an individual are being met 
    * Technically, communication with the professor is possible, however the learning opportunities are seriously limited because of the limits of virtual visual interaction and testing/quiz platforms 
* Limitations on the discussion sections- uploading a discussion post as a video - the 40 second video did not upload (even a 5 second test video did not upload well)
* 


**Existing Resources**
* ASL Education examples:[ The ASL Lab](https://www.instagram.com/theasllab/?hl=en), [Atmoic Hands](https://www.atomichands.com/) (STEM through ASL-centric resources),

**To Remember** 
* Do not assume that because someone is d/Deaf/Hard of Hearing they are a visual learner 
    * visuals can help learners, and ASL is a visual language, but it is always best practice to ask students/educators their preferred method who receiving and submitting materials 
* Start a conversation with student(s) and find out what accommodations will best support their learning 
    * Familiarize yourself with the departments/school interpreting offerings/policy 
    * For example, let's say you have a recorded video assignment/audio assignment (i.e. recording a podcast or creating a recorded zoom presentation) and the student communicates using ASL - are they required to caption their own video (something that can take a significant amount of time) or do they have access to an interpreter to speak while they sign for the video? 
    * Some lectures have captioning available -- for some that is sufficient and some will want an interpreter.

**Canvas Extension**
* [Canvas Studio ](https://www.instructure.com/higher-education/products/canvas/canvas-studio)
    * Seems like Panapto has been accessibility features 

* Panapto (currently used at Harvard)
    * Using Panopto instead for student recordings to minimize upload/download issues

**Harvard Resources and Tools**
* Students, Staff, and Faculty have access to [Adobe Creative Cloud ](https://harvard.service-now.com/ithelp?id=kb_article&sys_id=9f3244d3dba304d430ed1dca489619e0)

**Visual Learning Tools**

Digital Collaborative Platforms: These can work well for class assignments, collaboration between students, 
* [Padlet ](https://padlet.com/)
    * Upload files (including images, gifs, videos, etc. )
    * Multiple videos can be uploads in one thread or multiple threads on a page 
    * customizable base on needs of a given course/project 
    * Limitations: 3 free padlets - after that there is a monthly/annual fee, commenting on a video can only be done through text, video recording can be up to 5 minutes long, 
    * Sample for how it can be used: https://padlet.com/sarahrosenthal2/w4z950rreblp8033

* [Popplet ](https://www.popplet.com/)
    * offers a visual platform where videos and images can be easily uploaded, but users are not able to record a video right on the platform, it must be an external website
* [EdPuzzle](https://edpuzzle.com/) - a good platform for teachers to record and organized videos 
    * Limitations - there are different expentions you need in order to record on the platform, there is aboth a teacher and student version of the site that can be used 
    * Video can be embedded into LMS (ie. can connect to canvas) 
    * Using a class code - students can create their own account and share videos as well 
    * Includes video editor 
    * can have a file that is a combination of existing content and newly made content 
    * Can embed questions into the video 
    * Basic plan -- storage for 20 video lessons 


**For supporting students** 
* Consider the different moments of interaction a student has with the course 
    * Course shopping and registration 
    * Syllabus and LMS (at Harvard this is primarily canvas)
    * Communicating with professors and teaching fellows (office hours, during class, etc)
    * Course assignments (papers, discussion posts, projects - group and individual)
    * Quizzes and tests 
    * Other learning platforms (other LMS, web based - ie Padlet, etc)

Other things to look into: 

* Thinklink 
* brain pop 
* discovery education
