## the ask:

### SHOW!

Give us a quick description of what you have been working on, show us something! It's always great if you can share some media (images, videos, github repos).

### TELL!

And then unpack it a bit and help us understand the rationale for why this thing matters (to you, but also to improving the teaching+learning here at Harvard).

### TEACH!

If there's a small "taste of learning" you can offer us, that would be amazing (like a 5-10 minute activity that gives us a taste of what the students did in the workshop).
