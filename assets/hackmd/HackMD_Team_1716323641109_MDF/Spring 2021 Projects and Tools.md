# Spring 2021 Projects and Tools

During the December 3 MDF meeting, a group of us discussed possible spring projects, tools and moves we're excited to learn (in some cases, in support of a particular course and in others, in support of departmental goals or possible courses we'll work with). Below are some of the ideas we came up with, which we'll continue to prototype over J-term and implement during the spring.

### Juhee
Juhee has been working on a teaching resources database for GENED 1091. Juhee has been using Airtable to compile this data and is starting to think about how to turn this Airtable into a website that is both user-friendly and attractive in design. Juhee also wants to develop a gallery-style website that showcases creative student projects (e.g., portraits students have created, short videos of dance performances, etc.). 

Juhee will be working with EASCB 17 in the spring. and seems to have a need similar to GENED 1091 (Juhee's fall course) for database-turned-website of teaching resources for TFs.

Juhee's tools and forms of interest are: Airtable, Photoshop, web design, other Adobe design tools

### Xiaomeng

Xiaomeng is interested in doing more work for MCB courses in the spring, building on her graphic abstracts, interviews, and scientific concept animation projects from this fall, all of which supported MCB 80. During j-term, Xiaomeng will work with the Illustrating Ideas cluster on the comics spread prototype. She's specifically interested in prototyping a comics spread that could be used in an MCB course to illustrate course concepts in an engaging way. Additionally, Xiaomeng is working on producing transcripts from the recorded interviews with scientists talking about how to read scientific research papers. These transcripts would serve as a resource for future students, supplementing the video clips.

Xiaomeng's tools and forms of interest are: Clip Studio, Adobe After Effects, ProCreate

### Eduarda

Eduarda is interested in developing materials for AAAS in the domains of mapping and illustration. Specifically, Eduarda discussed the possibility of developing materials that would augment lectures and assignments in AAAS. One project that Eduarda is especially keen to support is the [Harvard & the Legacy of Slavery project](https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/about-the-institute/our-work/harvard-and-the-legacy-of-slavery-2), based in Radcliffe. We discussed the possibility of developing geocodes in Airtable that could then be turned into a map.

Eduarda's tools and forms of interest are: Premiere, Illustrator, Timeline JS, maybe Airtable and some coding-related tools?

### Tica
Tica is working on the SEAS vizualization project and an internal LL project organized around datavis and AR/VR. This internal project will ideally culminate in a virtual rendering of the LL! Tica wants to do more work in the zone of Airtable-to-____ (as do many of us!). Tica is excited about supporting humanities projects as she sees these as content-rich projects that her CS knowledge could help support (since Tica understands the tools necessary to realize these projects).

Tica's tools and forms of interest are: D3 and javascript for datavis, Airtable, Blender, and Unity + AR/VR (for developing the LL model)

### Jessi

Jessi is excited to turn the resources she created this semester, which aim to help students and faculty think about the "moves" we make and positions we occupy in classrooms and other learning environments, into a guidebook. Jessi also expressed interest in working with Aysha Upchurch's Duet Studio project (based in HGSE). Jessi will also develop set pieces and community building exercises that will assist LL workshops and courses, as well as support the LLUFs and MDFs.

Jessi's tools and forms of interest are: Airtable, tablescapes/index-card and overhead related activities, and After Effects

### Ignacio
Ignacio is working with AFVS in the spring, in a course that covers cinema and production. He's interested (like Christine) in learning more about cameras and lighting, as he sees this AFVS course as potentially a great way to get students into the LL using cameras and lights in support of their course work and assignments. **fill in more** 

### Marlon
Marlon is starting to plan for Harvard Horizons and is thinking about ways to expand our work with Expos 20 courses, especially developing more set pieces for Expos workshops. Marlon has also been developing some projects for Dec/Jan ("j-term projects"), which right now include a comic book prototype and stuff in the multimodal essay zone. 

Marlons tools and forms of interest are: Airtable, Blender, Unity (especially AR - like Tica!)

### Christine
Christine is excited about the j-term projects and continuing to get the MDF reports ready to share with departments. Christine also wants to develop set pieces for workshops with Marlon and Jordan. Some of the j-term projects she'll work on include the comic book spread prototype, the multimodal essay inventory/resources, and stuff related to virtual galleries(?). She is super excited to learn to use the cameras and lights as well! 

Christine's tools and forms of interest are: Blender, cameras and lights, Airtable, Adobe Illustrator and Capture; maybe InDesign too (perhaps for the comic book spread?)
