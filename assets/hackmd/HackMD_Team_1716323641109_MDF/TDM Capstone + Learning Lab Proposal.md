# TDM Capstone + Learning Lab Proposal 

### For the Spring 2022-2023 school year, the [Learning Lab](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/learning-lab) will be working with TDM to support courses in design, documentation, and media literacy. This partnership will be spearheaded by [Jessi Stegall](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/people/jessi-stegall), a Media & Design Fellow at the Learning Lab. 

#### In partnering with the Junior & Senior Capstone courses, Jessi will offer workshops at the Learning Lab (pictured below) to support TDM concentrators in *documenting and displaying* their work through:
#### 

* [Learning about the value and possibilies of digital portfolios](#Fall-Workshop-#1:-Who,-What,-Why-Portfolios?)
* [Documentation tools (photo, video, digital notes)](#Fall-Workshop-#2:-Documentation-of-Process)
* [Organization and curation methods (artist statements, social media branding, project descriptions)](#Spring-Workshop-#1:-Branding-Yourself-and-the-Work)
* [Online Tools used for building digital portfolios](#Spring-Workshop-#2:-Designing-Your-Portfolio)


**For junior capstone students, Jessi will offer workshops on:**

* [Generating Media-Inclusive Capstone Ideas](#FALL-workshop:-Generating-Media-Inclusive-Capstone-Ideas) 
* [Introduction to Process Documentation](#SPRING-workshop:-Introduction-to-Process-Documentation)

#### As an output, Jessi will build a metaportfolio site for all senior thesis students, featuring a headshot, artist statement, and project description for each.


###### **For students that want to go beyond the workshops and create a portfolio in full, Jessi will offer addtional optional workshops for students to flesh out their digital portfolio.

## Additional Support

* **Personalized capstone media support**

In addition to providing workshops that introduce all capstone students to media tools, Jessi will also be available as a personalized support for students who have an interest in incorporating a media component into their final thesis project. These meeting would be by appointment and would go beyond the baseline information provided in the workshops.
    
* **Iterative Student Interview**
    
If students are interested in documenting their own thinking throughout their process in a meta-cognitive format, Jessi is available to record & edit interviews with the students throughout the semester. At the end of their project, students will recieve an edited compilation of themselves that tracks how their thinking has developed over time.
