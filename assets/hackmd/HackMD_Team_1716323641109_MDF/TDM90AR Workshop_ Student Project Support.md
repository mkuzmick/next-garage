# TDM90AR Workshop: Student Project Support

### For the Spring 2022-2023 school year, the [Learning Lab](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/learning-lab) will be working with TDM to support courses in design, documentation, and media literacy. This partnership will be spearheaded by [Jessi Stegall](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/people/jessi-stegall), a Media & Design Fellow at the Learning Lab. 


#### In partnering with TDM90AR, Jessi will offer a workshop at the Learning Lab (pictured below) that:

* Introduces students to the Learning Lab as a resource
* Teaches them basic film & photography documentation skills
* Introduces them to a shared google drive "media pool" where they can access Learning Lab footage and add their own media from class
* Introduces them to milanote, a free online tool they can use to document progression of their "track" assignment throughout the semester
