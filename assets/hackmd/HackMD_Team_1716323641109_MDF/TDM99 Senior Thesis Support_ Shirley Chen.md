# TDM99 Senior Thesis Support: Shirley Chen
**Fall 2022**
**Advisor: Ju Yon Kim**

For her Senior Thesis Project, Shirley is performing a one-woman show at Sackler Oct 21-21. She spent the summer in San Fransisco researching the ***Miss Chinatown USA Pageant***, where she interviewed former contestants and used this data to create four fictional characters who she will play in her production.

In addition to her performance, Shirley plans to set up an **art installation in classroom 112** next to the performance space in Sackler for the duration of her performances.

## How will the Learning Lab support this project?

Jessi (MDF) will support the art installation aspect of this project in two ways:

1. [Support the general curation and design of the space](#General-installation-design/curation)
2. [Provide technological equipment and support for projection in the installation](#Projections)

**What are we doing?**

By pairing objects, physical images, and projection, Jessi will help Shirley design a installation layout that includes 3-4 vignettes:

1. Living Room vignette (vintage household items)
2. Hanging clothing (hanging dresses, gloves, and other fabric from the cieling to create a "sea of satin")
3. Image story-telling (pinning images on the wall to tell stories of real contestants from the pageant)


**What do we need to provide?**

* small hooks to hang from ceiling and hang clothes (they have fishing wire)
* printing out the photos to be pinned on the wall
* magnets? for hanging photos

**When will this happen?****

The space is currently available to start loading in equipment and materials at any time


## Projections


**What are we doing?**

Jessi will set up projectors around the installation 

**What do we need to provide?**

* projectors (1 from us, 2 from her)
* stands/base for projectors to sit on?

**When will this happen?****

The space is currently available to start loading in equipment and materials at any time.
