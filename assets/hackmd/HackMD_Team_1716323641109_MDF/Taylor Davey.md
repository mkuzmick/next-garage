# Taylor Davey
**Bok - GSD**

mapLab
    * 4-5 workshops or resource packs leading up to a capstone project
    * thinking about programs students could use
    * GIS
    * workshops vs online resources?
    * other options
    
    
Taylor and Marlon had a great chat about **mapLab**, zeroing in on a potential assignment sequence that would take students from sketching out maps with paper and pencil to using digital tools for a capstone project. Taylor will be making [the notes Marlon took here](https://hackmd.io/Rc39uMt1SeWF2qTo0LPW1w?view) much better over the coming week!
