I am hoping to continue working on my T550 project/iLab idea through the end of the school year. I am exploring the world of Adobe and am interested in creating a professional document to present an example lesson plan and a possible scope and sequence of units for the curriculum at the end of the year. I'm also interested in possibly creating/authoring a children's book that may connect to this project. 

I would like to learn more about digital media and design applications to help me create this curriculum in order to share my ideas. I think joining a team that utilizes some of these technologies would be beneficial to my growth. 

I am interested in digging deeper into the work you do at TLL. I'm curious if the schedule will remain the same in terms of the lab and meeting times during the Spring semester. I'm a bit concerned about scheduling because I want to make sure there are enough events I could attend while being able to take the courses that I'm interested in.
