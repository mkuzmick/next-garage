# Time Capsuled Interview 

### Using documentary-style interviews, students will be given the opportunity to document changes in their learning, opinions, and goals throughout a course or project.

***Why document shifts in learning?***

* Students and teachers have the opportunity to study why and how learning happens rather than merely evaluating the product of it
* Itâ€™s easier to weave feedback loops through the experience, increasing the likelihood that learners will reap the greatest rewards from the assessment process
* Students can use the documentation to build a timeline or portfolio for their project

***Why use documentary-style filmed interviews?***

* By watching themselves back, students can **meta-cognitively** crystallize and synthesize their own learning objectives
* Students are encouraged to directly respond to their past selves in conversation style rather than filtering through writing
* Footage can be edited together (Vanity Fair style) so that students and teachers can easily compare and contrast changes in thinking/learning

**Bonus: it makes for great promotional footage, and more fun for teachers to review!
