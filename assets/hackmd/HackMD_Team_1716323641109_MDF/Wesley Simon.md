# Wesley Simon
**Department:** AFVS
**Courses:** Art of Film - Laura Frahm, AFVS 152X: The Essay Film - Alfred Guzzetti


## Projects

### Meta Essay Film
Wesley is currently editing audio interviews with AFVS faculty Alfred Guzzetti, who teaches the Essay Film course and planning to pair it with clips from essay films that appear in the conversation (Sans Soleil, The Man with the Movie Camera, Two or Three Things I Know About Her).
This fall he plans to have a rough draft of the Meta Essay Film project.
In the spring he plans to screen/share a final draft of the project ahead of or alongside the Essay Film Workshop, probably around the midterm.

### Art of Film Website
Wesley is reworking the design, but minimal progress here as he hasn't been able to get any further information from the original designer.
This fall he plans to complete the front-end design of the website.
In the spring he plans to move the domain and build a new site with the new front end designs, set it up to showcase student projects.

### Essay Film Workshop
We've held two out of the three workshops, though it was disrupted by the strike and some of the original students didn't return, while some new students jumped in midway.  Was still a success, though I'm concerned a second strike might derail the final workshop.  Overall, I still feel good about running that workshop in the Spring.
