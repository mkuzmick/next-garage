# Zane Wolf
**Department:** OEB
**Courses:** Sea Monsters, Deep Sea Biology - Pete Girguis



## Augmenting-Space Lab Workshops

### [Mapbox Tutorial](https://hackmd.io/JrzTNK-FSqKUOrbD1deeog)
```
tags: data, no-code, in-person
status: Complete
```
An in-person tutorial introducing Mapbox and working through creating a basic map using a dataset concerning the health of trees in NYC. 


### [Data Visualization Part 1: Encoding Data](https://hackmd.io/ia25si6HTD2_MBiwwdjGCQ?both)
```
tags: sketching, data, no-code, in-person
status: Complete
```
An in-person (but could be asynchronous) workshop that gives information about how to encode data as visual elements and contains activities for practicing different aspects of encoding data (reviewing some example data, sketching the same data different ways, and developing a sketching process for the sample data [picking a target audience, outlining questions, sketching visualizations designed to 'match' each question]).

### [Data Visualization Part 2: Design Process for SEAS Visualization](https://hackmd.io/hh5C34jcQm-IOYwmAsnh1Q) 
```
tags: sketching, data, zoom
status: Complete
```
An in-person (zoom) workshop led primarily by Tica where we introduced the SEAS Faculty project, gave them the data, and repeated the sketching process introduced in Part 1.

### [Data Visualization Part 3: Coding Data](https://hackmd.io/JDifXR_fT--uRVrSNa3F6Q)
```
tags: d3, codepen, in person via zoom, asynchronous?
status: Complete
```
An asynchronous (or possibly in-person) workshop that walks through a basic D3 visualization example. It assumes no prior knowledge of coding, and contains information about HTML, CSS, Javascript, debugging steps, and coding best practices. D3 topics covered: svg, enter/update/exit (conceptually), drawing circles, conditional styling, text labels, hover tooltip. 

### [Data Visualization Part 4: Coding Volcanic Data](https://hackmd.io/yRIrE6miQYS5BWFFqMzjRg) 
```
tags: d3, codepen, in-person? 
status: In Development
```
An in-person workshop that builds upon the code taught in Part 3, but students return to the volcano data that they encountered in Part 1 and has them make a visualization (TBD). D3 topics I want to cover: scales, adding chart axes, maybe a selection box and filtering the data to show how the enter/update/exit thing actually works, and/or data manipulation?

### Potential Workshops
* Collaboration between Illustrating Ideas and Augmenting Space Labs, where for a SMALL data set, people prototype a sketch using pen/paper, but then make their final sketch using Affinity Designer/Adobe Illustrator/ProCreate. Essentially my [Data Designer](https://github.com/zanewolf/dataDesigner) projects.
* Data viz in Blender




## Projects 

### [SEAS Faculty Dataviz Project](/QxfbARRcT42Y6F8ESR2ctw)
```
tags: data visualization, d3 
course: SEAS Department
status: In Progress
```
In collaboration with Eliza, a SEAS administrator, and her partner Nahn from the CS 171 course, Tica Lin and myself are helping Eliza and Nahn make both encoding improvements, aesthetic improvements, and eventually backend/frontend improvements to their visualizations that describe interdepartmental collaborations at SEAS (Arc), shared research interests (Matrix), and connections between faculty, departments, and centers (Flow). Personally working on remaking the Flow into a Radial Flow and the updating the Matrix.

### [Ocean Affinity Group Website](/f3E7SwY1SSewGOmLmAa3gA)
```
tags: gatsby, airtable, netlify, directory, responsive
course: Interdepartmental iniative, Pete Girguis
status: In Progress
```
This website is being developed to support Pete's new initiative, OAG, meant to connect people from various ocean-affiliated centers, departments, academic areas, institutes, etc (People Directory) and collect a list of resources and opportunities available across the board (Opportunities Directory), as it can be hard to know what grants, fellowships, internships, etc are out there. The data is stored in and pulled from airtable, where people can add themselves to the directory using an airtable form.

### [Sea Monsters Website Project](/IOyyuTY-TIKmUo1qf99j5g)
```
tags: React, firebase, gallery, game
course: Sea Monsters freshman seminar
status: Paused/Complete?
```
This website is a gallery to host drawings of monsters created by students in the Sea Monsters seminar. It also includes a memory card game. The data is hosted and pulled from Firebase. It's currently at a point where it could be considered complete, but there are features I'd like to add (store the local high score, shoot high score up to firebase at end of session, create a high scores game page and visual) and improvements to make to the code (e.g. make it responsive).

### [Deep Sea Biology Project](/Dn7_nNbHQB6WPzFa1l24rg)
```
tags: data visualization, course project, presentation
course: OEB 119, Pete Girguis
status: Paused/In Progress
```
Changing the month-long final project that students have completed in the past (a literature review to answer a novel question): give them a set of videos and data, have them complete their own 'mini-research' project. Develop a question, visualize the data, collect data from the videos about the ecology/animals present, analyze the combined data, and present on their findings. Data provided by Schmidt Ocean Institute. 







## Other

### [Show & Tell: Map Drawing Activity](https://hackmd.io/@mdf/SJCpX3GDt)
Walked the MDF meeting through an activity involving drawing a global map from memory, encoding some information about their life on the map (e.g. where they've lived and for how long/doing what, where they've traveled/want to travel), and then swapping with someone and interpreting each other's maps. 

### [LL Basics: Datasets](https://hackmd.io/F6ZAGMFKSRaJnzr4Jmfo3w)
Collecting and curating a variety of datasets, both in subject and data type, to be easily accessible to people who simply need a practice dataset.

### [Types of Data Visualization Tools](https://hackmd.io/lixfvJKaRIK5zESwyQYNIQ)
A blog discussing the different categories/types of data visualization tools and their pros/cons/best uses.
