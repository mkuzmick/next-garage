**1. Empathize**
----

**2. Define**
----

**3. Ideate**
----

**4. Prototype**
----
**Tools**
* High-fidelity prototypes: Figma, Sketch (these two are very similar, so if you are familiar with one, it's very easy to pick up the other.)
* Low-fidelity prototypes: Basalmiq

If you don't have a preference, I recommend **Figma** because:
1. It's free for 3 projects, but you can create as many files within each project as you want.
2. It's easier to manage files on Figma.
3. It allows easy real-time collaboration.
4. It has a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Figmadesign) with comprehensive tutorials between 5-10 minutes
**Take advantage of free Figma templates**: https://www.figmacrush.com/free-figma-ui-kits/

**5. Test**
