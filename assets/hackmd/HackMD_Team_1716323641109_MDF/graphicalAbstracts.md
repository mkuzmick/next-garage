*Excerpt from a graphical abstract by MDF Xiaomeng Han.*

## about
In MCB80, students are encountering scientific papers for the first time. Every semester MCB 80 will cover several classical research papers that are important milestones in the field of neuroscience. MCB80 has a focus on science communication broadly, and professor Jeff Lichtman wants to create several graphic abstracts of classical papers in the field of neurobiology to show students how scientific research generates knowledge. We hope to make these graphic abstracts as straightforward demonstrations to show students how original research was conducted, and help them gain a better understanding of important findings and techniques.

### about the client
**Faculty:** Jeff Lichtman
**Course Title:** MCB/Neuro 80: Neurobiology of Behaviors 


### milestones
Our initial plan is to do two graphic abstracts for two papers. I plan to finish one each month (July and August). For each month, the plan is to first generate some rough ideas or to finish a sketch by the middle of the month. I will share the rough ideas and sketch with LL staff and the MCB 80 course instructors to get some feedback. Then I will make adjustments and begin to work on the final draft.  I will share again the final draft by the end of the month to receive feedback, and keep working based on the feedback to finish the final version of the graphic abstracts.
