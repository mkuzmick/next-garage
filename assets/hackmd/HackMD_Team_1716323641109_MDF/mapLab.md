## notes from 20210916

The basic idea so far is to develop an activity sequence that moves from physical to digital maps over the course of the term, culminating in a capstone assignment that will involve mapping Harvard (which could be understood in many ways).

### Types of maps 

In the initial activity, students will mainly sketch and work with paper and other physical materials in the LL.

The modes of mapping they'll encounter will include
* wayfinding
* analytical/thematic
* topological
* info/topographic map


### Keyterms for mapping

In the second activity, students will begin to learn some of the key "moves" of mapping, and will work on a single term in a collective glossary of mapping terms. They will create an entry in markdown that embeds a piece of media that helps to illustrate the term, then they will write 50-200 words that explain the term and why it matters. 

Some of the tools, elements, moves, etc. include

* figure
* ground
* resolution
* scale
* balance of elements


### Getting out into the physical world

Still under development: one activity should involve going outside and doing something related to Harvard's campus. Potentially also involving capturing some geotagged media?

Some options:
* getting media, lat and long from places on campus?
* write a script that pulls the lat and long from captured media and stores in an Airtable record?
* generate some sort of google map or storymap?

### Digital tools

* intro to key digital tools for doing all of this well

### Capstone Project

* putting it all together?
