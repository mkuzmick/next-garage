# realityLab notes


ideas towards a (very tentative) plan by Tica and MK


* let's think of an array of activities and projects for the Fall term
* it would be great if interested undergraduates could proceed through an array of 4-7 activities that "level up" their skills in tools like Unity, Blender, etc. over the course of the term
    * they are, in a sense "testing" the tutorials you might create for a course
    * they are ALSO learning to contribute assets to your projects (and maybe even code in certain circumstances)
* great ideas for deliverables include
    * proofs of concept of things we can imagine a Harvard course wanting
        * AR-enriched experiences of Harvard's campus (where we encounter location-specific stories, images, 3d models that align with a given discipline's content (like History))
        * prototypes of things we can imagine doing in museums (virtual tours, AR maps overlain on top of the physical museum, annotations on top of artifacts and paintings)
        * examples of potential student AR assignments. If I, as a student were to MAKE an AR installation or world for a course, what might this look like and what would the steps be?
    * projects that make the LL Studio better in any way
        * AR data on top of LL walls that tells the story of LL projects and people
        * the ability to show the results of students' 3D work in the physical studio (i.e. if we run a Blender workshop, how quickly can we get their work "visible" in the physical space)
        * game mechanics in the physical space


## Project Ideas
1. Virtual gallery for Learning Lab project demo
    * Unity Tutorial for anyone who wants to create their own virtual gallery of work
    * A template that serves as an easy starting point for other MDF and LLUF to develop for any courses
        * e.g. Historic timeline, showcasing art pieces or photos
    * `Deliverables:` Workshop materials (video, slides, etc), Virtual gallery code base
    * Create virtual learning lab in Blender?

2. AR museum in Learning Lab
    * Create interactive project demo space with AR image tracking and 3D modeling.
    * `Deliverables:` AR museum code base, executable application

3. 3D data visualization exploration
    * Create a Harvard Campus virtual tour with 3D map and data visualization 
    * Map temperal and spatio data into 3D space with immersive visualization
    * `Deliverables:` project showcase, video
