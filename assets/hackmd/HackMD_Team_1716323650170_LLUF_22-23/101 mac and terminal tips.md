# 101 mac and terminal tips

let's come up with an array of tips for using our macs (and if we have time the Terminal) for undergrads.

1. `command` + `space` = launch spotlight, then type in the app you want to launch and hit enter
2. you can also open documents and scripts using spotlight 
3. if you want to change spotlight preferences, go to "System Preferences", then "Spotlight", then uncheck the things you don't want to search for
4. `command` + `f` in pretty much any app to search for where terms appear on the page
5. When using `command` + `f`, you can use `command` + `g` to move forward through your search results.
6. Meanwhile, `command `+ `g` + `shift` moves backwards through `command` +`f` results
7. command + tab cycles through the apps you have open
8. relatedly, if you "arm" your cursor with a file you are dragging around, you can command tab over to the app you want to drop this file into
9. `command` + `` ` `` will cycle through the windows you have open in one and the same app
10. four finger drag up moves everything out of the way
11. (LL only--maybe let's debate this as a policy) two finger tap is right-click
12. (LL only--three finger drag will drag files etc.). If you want to change this in code, use this line

```
defaults write com.apple.AppleMultitouchTrackpad TrackpadThreeFingerDrag -bool true
```

11. Split screen by hovering over the green button in the top left hand corner of the app, then choose "Tile Window to Left of Screen"
12. four finger swipe left and right to go from space to space
13. command + shift + 4 to create screenshot
14. if two apps are full screen, swipe four fingers up and then you can drag one on top of the other's desktop icon to split screen
15. bookmarking in Safari and Chrome (`command` + `d`)
16. in finder command shift n = new window5
17. command + shift + v in google docs = paste with styling6
18. command + shift + v in fcpx = paste properties of old clip to new clip7

20. `command` + `T` new tab
22. `option` or `option` + `shift` gives access to different suites of characters
23. `command` + `w` to close window or tab
24. `command` + `n` for new window in most cases
25. `command` + `h` for hiding all windows in your currently open app
