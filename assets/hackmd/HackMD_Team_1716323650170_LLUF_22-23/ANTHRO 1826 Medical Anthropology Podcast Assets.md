# ANTHRO 1826 Medical Anthropology Podcast Assets

tl;dr: find some music beds, record some voiceover of you reflecting on a reading you've done in a course, and find some "primary source" audio that relates to your reading (like a clip from an interview or a news program).

## prompt

In ANTHRO 1826, students will make podcasts where they record their reflections about the course readings. These podcast episodes are also intended to be a kind of tribute to a late anthropologist, so they're likely to be quite intimate/personal in tone. 

Can you find some different types of audio that students could experiment with during their podcast workshop here? Ideally, we'd have:
* music beds
* some voiceover narration
* some audio clips that function as kind of primary source data, are archival/set up some kind of story/mystery that the voiceover/narrator will unpack
