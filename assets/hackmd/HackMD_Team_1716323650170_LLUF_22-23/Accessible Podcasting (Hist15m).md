# Accessible Podcasting (Hist15m) 

Discoveries so far:
* varying thoughts on whether Adobe Audition can be used with screenreaders - it seems recent updates mean yes, it can
* Garageband can be used with Voiceover (Apple's screenreader) however it has received criticism for not being super comprehensive or consistent with updates to the programme
* Keyboard shortcuts are helpful
    * a list of shortcuts for Garageband can be found here:

Potentially useful resources:
* a article: "Podcasting for the Blind & Partially Sighted"
    * from 2017 so slightly dated but good overview
    * https://www.thepodcasthost.com/niche-case-study/podcasting-for-the-blind-partially-sighted/
* The Blind Podmaker - a podcast on Apple with "tips, tricks, demos, tutorials and resources all produced with the blind podcast creator in mind"
