## Editing

### Timeline

#### Bringing clips into the timeline
To bring clips into the timeline from the browser, you can: select segments by clicking and dragging parts of the clips in the browser, select segments with "i" and "o", add by dragging the entire clip into the timeline, or add with E and Q.

#### Manipulating the timeline

There are a few ways to manipulate clips in the timeline. You can shorten/lengthen them by clicking the right or left handle of the clip, and then pulling to the left or right. You can cut out a portion of the clip by using the 'B' key to activate the blade tool.

To zoom into the timeline, press "cmd" and "+". To zoom out of the timeline, press "cmd" and "-". 

#### Moving clips within the timeline

The timeline is magnetic, so by default, any clip you manipulate will be magnetically pulled toward the clip it is adjacent to. 

Press 'N' to toggle snapping. When enabled and when moving a clip in a timeline, snapping will easily pull one clip to another. When disabled, the clip will move more freely, but it may not perfectly align to the end or beginning fo an adjacent clip. 

### Inspector

You can change the basic video properties in the inspector. You can change the size (scale), position (x & y), and audio.

You can also change the properties of titles and effects.
