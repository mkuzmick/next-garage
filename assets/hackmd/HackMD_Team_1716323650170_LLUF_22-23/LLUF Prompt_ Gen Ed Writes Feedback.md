# LLUF Prompt: Gen Ed Writes Feedback

## Background
The Bok Center recently launched [Gen Ed Writes](https://genedwrites.fas.harvard.edu), an online resource aimed at supporting writing in General Education courses. Beyond Gen Ed, we think that the website would be useful for assignments in general. 

Specifically, Gen Ed Writes tries to break down the elements of writing assignments from both instructor-facing and student-facing perspectives, so that everyone “doing” an assignment—the designers, the teachers, and the students—can get on the same page about:
* what they’re doing,
* why they’re doing it, and 
* how they can best give and receive feedback on a wide range of assignments involving writing. 

## Prompt
At this stage in the site’s development, we’re hoping to get feedback about what’s working well and what could use more work, and we invite you to visit [Gen Ed Writes](https://genedwrites.fas.harvard.edu) and give us your feedback through a [user survey for students](https://harvard.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3I6WT0a8rpoTR7U). 

### Framing
In order to “think yourself” into the mindset of a user taking the survey, it might be helpful to think about the papers/assignments you’re doing now—Gen Ed courses are ideal, but other courses are totally fine. Or maybe think back to last term, if you aren’t doing any papers or projects now, or if you had one in a recent term that you found challenging to work on. If you have a prompt for one or two of these assignments available and handy, that’s great (but not 100% necessary).

Now imagine that someone says to you, “Hey, I see you’re working on that assignment for xyz course. Have you checked out Gen Ed Writes? You should!” And so you do, and after ~30 minutes to an hour looking through the site and/or using the site’s resources you’re in a great position to start the user survey.

### Elements
* browse [Gen Ed Writes](https://genedwrites.fas.harvard.edu) for 30 minutes to an hour
* complete the [survey](https://harvard.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3I6WT0a8rpoTR7U), which should take around 20 minutes to complete.
    * Note that the survey is **anonymous**. Once you get to the end, there is a link to a different survey that will ask for your name so that we can enter you into a raffle to win your choice of wireless earbuds or a fleece blanket!

### Deadline
End of term (December 16)
