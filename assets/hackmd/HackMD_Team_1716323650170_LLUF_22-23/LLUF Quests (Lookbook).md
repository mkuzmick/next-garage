# LLUF Quests (Lookbook)

NOTES
-take a video of ourselves as our characters --> superimpose that onto our "levels" so that we are the characters moving on the chalkboard! could be a fun AR add (imagine putting your phone to the board and seeing people running around! so cool :D)
-we could have all the skills printed onto many buttons and placed into a "skills pool" somewhere on the board, and as LLUFs "earn" the skills, the buttons are brought over to their character cards!
-we can photograph candids as we learn skills (ourselves, of other people, etc) and montage those together/take videos and make a music video or something cool with motion and live stills/photos from the skill learning process! cool way to see progress as skills are learned, get funny bloopers and some b-reels, as well as metacognition as we reflect on our growth! :D
-we definitely need a "leveled up" screen/photo/video/GIF DEFINITELY A GIF!!! and an "all levels complete" bossmode screen --> or maybe a portrait at the end of the year! :DDDDD
-question: how much info do we want physically on the board versus visible only through AR? (all skills, only symbols of skills with more info virtually, bios online --> just a portrait mural on the screen rather that explicit player cards, etc)


example of a "skills tree" -- from Skyrim

this is what a skills tree looks like inside

here's the inventory from HZD

from HZD, could be fun to put onto buttons!

We can collect different video game items as we go, like the Rings from Sonic the Hedgehog, mushrooms from Mario, or anything else cool!

WE DEFINITELY NEED A "FINAL STAGE/LEVELED UP" SCREEN!!!

Super Mario Level Up "example of different worlds"

example from Rogue Legacy -- separate physical levels on the same screen

Dota 2 - example of sets or costume of a character

Dota 2 - example at the bottom showing a character portrait and their skills and items. We could also use buttons since they fit in tiny boxes!
![](https://i.imgur.com/VF4Q08d.jpg)

Dead by Daylight - another example of maybe a character sheet where we have our main "power" and our top 4 programs/skills as well as other skills we have picked up during our time here (we may have tried many things but not mastered them). I also like the idea of our skills having levels (in DBD perks have 3 tiers) so maybe our skills can have tiers based on how comfortable we are with them.

Dead by Daylight - an example of purple tiers and differnt items

Dead by Daylight - this web could correlate to the branching of different skills. So for button making, the central node would be buttons and maybe the branching ones could be magnets, bottle cap openers, etc. Basically as we branch off in a main skill we can track how deep we follow a skill.

Dead by daylight - another example of a web (more linear instead of circular)

Inscryption - make wooden characters and put them on a map

Citroulle Levels game -- imagine making each level the trusses from the LL as the ground, and you have to advance (and slay the monsters/personal growth!) by climbing ladders (or some other cool "this way up" climbing device) to get to the next levels!

Donkey Kong levels

movement between worlds and levels (Super Mario World)
![](https://i.imgur.com/w8VEpxx.jpg)


Life Is Strange -- the gameplay here is that you can slow down time, so imagine we take videos of ourselves learning a skill in slow-mo to slow down time --> could be fun if we can augment ourselves into the videos/enter into other people's/make a montage/make a music videooooo! :DDDDD

LLUF character customization
Everskies

Rogue Legacy -- has the skills next to the character (the little symbols next to the skills could be fun to print onto buttons!)

LLUF character select panels
Super Smash Bros

Mortal Kombat

Super Mario Kart!!!
![](https://i.imgur.com/AehjKej.jpg)
THIS IS SUCH A CUTE CHARACTER SELECT AREA!!! we can do 3D portraits and have us all standing around (on the 2D space make it look 3D) which could be super cute and cool and make it more real --> more photo visible)
![](https://i.imgur.com/cKNLPCB.png)



LLUF player cards
Pokemon -- imagine putting ourselves (in a cool pose!!!) in the photo portion of the card, and a quick description and our top skills on the card! good chance to frame your own story

Unlock levels/skills
![](https://i.imgur.com/nN8NqpI.jpg)

Assemble groups/squads and have fun competition
Maybe "shuffle" player card deck for random groups during labs

Each player profile and "stat" overview

In-game chat; space for group discussion

LLUF Family portrait
![](https://i.imgur.com/V93cJiW.jpg)

I like this illustration style and the way elements are added! plus text can be used for bio. Plus, could use front and back of card to add information and create an animation to flip the card on the site.

moving between the different worlds

Battle Start screen -- could be fun when we're starting a lab, we can put it on the wall to signal the theme and start!
![](https://i.imgur.com/p8YJJRJ.png)


Can have "traits" listed somewhere on the player card as the AR visual prompt that phones can lock onto (also cool to note is that skills could go as symbols underneath a portrait --> less of a card and more of a 3D headshot with skills underneath, as seen on the right here)
![](https://i.imgur.com/pv4Q4dq.jpg)

Can also do characters as just vertical portraits, horizontally aligned
![](https://i.imgur.com/Y9WJrag.png)

Writing your bio in sentence form, with a funny fact at the end! (nice to note that abilities are listed at the end, could be fun to scan)
![](https://i.imgur.com/TFxJbDT.jpg)

could be fun to put player cards in a specific place when you're leading a workshop, working with another LLUF on a project, etc! (fun to show which characters are active/who's been selected/"currently playing" or "friends online" etc)
