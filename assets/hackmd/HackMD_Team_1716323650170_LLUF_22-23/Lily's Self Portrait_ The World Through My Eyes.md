# Lily's Self Portrait: The World Through My Eyes

![](https://i.imgur.com/qIFWbjC.jpg)


## Description

In collaboration with Charlie McNamara, we created a stylized self portrait. The vibrance, kinetic shapes, and eager pose all represent to me the way I see the world: with energy, color, and a little bit of crazy. This project taught me how I can bring my subjective reality into a concrete image, and it led me to ask – through what other forms of media can I bring my perspective into my audience's lived reality?

### Materials

* Photoshop
* small studio cameras and lighting

### Process

1. Take several portrait photos. Vary your poses from professional, to candid, to hilariously staged.
2. Export your photos. If you want to stop here, export them into Lightroom and make your edits. If you want to (be cool and) keep going, you can view the photos on your desktop.
3. Open your desired photo in Photoshop. (Computer shortcut: right click the photo in Finder, select "Open With" --> "Photoshop")
4. Lock this photo as your base layer. You can give it a name like "Original" This will allow you to go back to this photo, with all its properties, if you need to.
5. Duplicate "Original" as a new layer. Name it "Black and White" You can click the left-side checkbox of "Original" to hide that layer.
6. For this style's aesthetic, you're going to desaturate the photo into a black and white image. In the adjustments panel (above your layers panel), click Black and White. This will create a new adjustment layer. Right click this new layer and select "Create Clipping Mask" This feature associates the adjustment layer with ONLY the layer directly below it – which should be your photo layer called "Black and White" That means if you add more layers to your image, they'll be in color, and the adjustment won't affect them.
7. Now that your image is in black and white, you'll want to increase the contrast so that everything pops. Mess around with new adjustment layers like Brightness/Contrast, Curves, etc. If you make a new layer, make sure you select "Create Clipping Mask"
     * For Brightness/Contrast: you can bring the contrast all the way up, which will help your edges become more clear. However, your image might become more grainy.
     * For Curves: you can make an "S-Curve" to edit the highlights and shadows in tandem. To make this curve, select a point on the top right third of the line, and drag it upwards. This makes your highlights higher. Then, select a point on the bottom left third of the line, and drag it downards. This makes your shadows darker. Play around until you find a mix that makes sense!
8. Now it's time to add fun shapes! You'll want to create a new layer for every shape that you draw, so you can edit each individual shape's properties without affecting any other shape or part of the image.
9. The following steps you can execute on repeat. :)
10. In a new layer, select the Pen tool on the left hand side of the screen. Draw whatever shape you want on your image – in mine, we drew a triangle from one end of the screen to another! To complete a shape, you need to connect your last point to your first point, or make them the same. 
11. With the Pen tool still selected, right click inside of your shape. Select "Fill Shape," and then "Color" Pick whatever color you want to fill your shape with!
12. To adjust the opacity of your shape so that you can see the image beneath it, select your shape's layer, then change the Opacity at the top of the layers panel.
13. Remember, Photoshop reads layers from top to bottom: so top layers will be on top of layers beneath them in your image! 
14. You can mess with any adjustments (as clipping masks) for your shapes to play with color, pattern, edge softness, etc. Have fun with it!
15. If you want to make any of your points curved, you can use the Curvature Pen tool. 
16. Repeat these steps until you've added all the shapes, colors, and patterns you want!
17. Now, you have a final image! Save the PSD file, and then click "Quick Export as PNG" Have fun and distribute!

### The Why

I've used the tools from this tutorial many times in making my own posters! For funsies, I've made a stylized portrait of my friend's dog for her birthday; for academics, I've made a movie poster. The clipping mask tool is extremely helpful to make sure your adjustments only affect one layer. For example, if you have a layer that's just the people in your image (probably through a "Select and Mask" --> "Mask Subject" move witht the Selection tool), you can adjust the colors of a background without affecting the people, and then you can adjust the exposure and clarity of the humans without affecting the colors in the background. Shapes are also great for graphic design elements, and understanding how layers work is essential for putting graphics in the right order. :) I find these tools super helpful, and they're also a fun creative outlet!

Go forth and have fun! (Or be foolish ;) )
