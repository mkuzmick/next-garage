# Logic Help Guide

### Context
*Helping the TDM concentrators create the music soundscapes for their plays.*

#### Steps

1. Opened up Logic to an empty Live Loop template
2. Click on loop browser button in top right corner

    * look through different loops, sorting by instrument, genre, tempo, and key

3. explain the difference between Audio and MIDI loops

    * Audio is the same sound no matter what instrument track you put it onto
    * MIDI is the specific notes being played — if you put it onto a guitar track it will be played by a guitar, and on a piano track it will be played by a piano.
        * you can also mess around with the length of each note and add/remove notes where you desire


4. Choose a track that fits the landscape of your world (in whatever way that looks like) and take note of the tempo and key

5. Add search through some other loops that feel like they fit, and drag them in the same column — it should create a new track
    * Make sure the file type matches the track type (ie. audio file in audio track, MIDI in MIDI track etc.), if not, you can just create a new file


6. Trigger a singular loop by pressing directly on it, or a whole column by pressing on the arrows at the bottom of the grid
