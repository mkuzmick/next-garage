# MCB 291 Buttons

tldr: make specific scicomm icon buttons from Ai assets for upcoming workshop

## prompt

This week we are supporting MCB 291, where at the beginning of the semester they study classic genetics from the 1800s-1900s (like Mendel time). Any drawings of things like chromosomes, plant and animal cells in mitosis and meiosis, early embryos, pea plants, egg and sperm cells, female fruit flies, male fruit flies, fruit flies with different mutations like white eyes or yellow bodies would be super helpful!


go to biorender.com and find these images, either download or screenshot them, post to show-your-images, and put the .md here for us to reference.
