# PSY1018: Psychology of Music thank you video prompt

Assigned to: Matthew

We led a workshop for Psychology of Music to get them introduced to an excitd about their final project: an explainer video. 

The basic structure of the workshop:
* an intro mini lecture by Christine and Jordan
* worktime
* 4 final presentations

#### Key Info: 
The Science and Psychology of Music
Workshop on Scientific Communication
* Where: LL, Main Studio
* When: Tuesday, September 14th 3pm - 4:15pm

### Ask
**a quick edit of the footage to send back to the course.** We want this to be done as quickly as possible, so don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good!

We want:
1. an edit of the final 4 presentations. this can be a single video that includes all 4. this can simply be the overhead cam-and if we have good audio we should include that
2. a short video of the intro lecture if it looks good
3. maybe a campy montage  of the entire thing, or at least a timelapse of the worktime that includes the four-up


## Elements
* You will edit from the sdx drive


 
## Tools
* the sdx drive

## Deliverable
* an export of the final edits as an mp4s, uploaded to [this folder.](link it)
* a post in show-your-work that includes a screenshot of your project (that doesn't have any students' faces in it) and a paragraph telling us about what you did. 
## Timeline
ASAP.
