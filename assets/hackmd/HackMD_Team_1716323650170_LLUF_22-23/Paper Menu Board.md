# Paper Menu Board

When: Every Monday Afternoon

## Background

This year we'll be working to move back and forth between the digital management of information in Airtable and it's real-world visibility on paper.

For this particular project, the goal is to print cards for each of the Airtable records relevant to our work for a given week, and to assemble these cards on the large whiteboard near the LL Studio sink/fridge area.

## Deliverables

By Monday afternoon
- small cards for each task
- medium cards for each microproject
- medium cards for each event
- large cards for each project not yet represented (or substantially changed)

If you are skilled in js, html and css, you can also help us with the code required to turn the Airtable records into cards. Let us know if you are interested.

## Tools

Airtable, Next JS, css, the printer, paper, knives, scissors, magnets.

## Steps

Open up the following links in your Chrome tabs 
- actions
- events
- projects
- microprojects
- shoots

Print everything from Chrome at a width that works with 3.5" wide columns and .25" gutters (1.625", 3.5", 7.25").

Assemble on the board.

## Next Steps

To push the project further, think a bit about the following challenges:

- dynamically varying the font
- weekly-calendar layout on board
- integration of images
- ways to use the cards once tasks and events are complete beyond recycling
-
