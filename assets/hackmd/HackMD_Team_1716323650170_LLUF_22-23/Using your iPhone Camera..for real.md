# Using your iPhone Camera..for real
You might have played around with resolution/fps settings or cinematic mode. But to make the most out of your iPhone camera, you need to get out of the **Camera App.**

Our focus will be on Super 16, as it is ~$25 cheaper. Lots of these points will translate to Filmic Pro should you choose to invest in that app.

## Getting Started
1. **Tap the screen** to open various sliders on the right. 
2. Find the slider for **film grain**. IF you're going for a film look, play around with this slider. But if you want a normal image, set it to zero.
3. Next, find the slider for **Temperature**. Point your camera at a blank piece of paper and play with this setting until the paper looks white. This is because white looks different under different lights (ex: a piece of paper lit by a fire is orange-tinted, while a piece of paper outside is blue-tinted)
4. If the image in your phone is very square-shaped, check the top right corner for a button with a ratio in it. This is the **aspect ratio**. You'll generally want to tap this until it says **16:9**. See the examples below:

 A 16:9 aspect ratio will capture more of the frame. 4:3, on the other hand, crops the image. I recommend shooting 16:9 and cropping to 4:3 if you want.

5. Now we want to make our image bright. Find the **Exposure Lock** in the bottom right (it's the lock with an "E"). Two wheels should appear:
* **ISO**: Play with this wheel until the **brightest part of your image** is about to become so bright it loses detail (this is called *clipping*)
* **exp**: I recommend setting this to 1/50s. You should see "24fps" in a box at the top of your image. As a general rule, set denominator of the exp setting to be **twice** the fps setting. So 24*2 = 48 --> ~1/50 exp setting.
6. Finally, we want to play with what's in focus. If you don't see a box labelled **ultra** at the top of your screen, you're ready. But if you do, click on it. Next, find the lock with an "F" on it in the bottom right. A new ring should appear labelled **fcs**. Play with it until you get your subject in focus.
