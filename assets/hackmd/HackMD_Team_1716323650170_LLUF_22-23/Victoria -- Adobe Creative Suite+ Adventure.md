## About
The COVID-19 pandemic showed how fragile institutional memory is and the importance of documentation. This is a personal work project to document my experiences and knowledge at the Learning Lab for future generations of LLUFs. I hope you find it as useful.

This guide dates back to April 2022 and will continue until I graduate in 2025. Its purpose is to **document** and create **guides** on the various multimedia tools in the Learning Lab.

## MacOS Shortcuts

LL mainly uses MacOS with keyboard and touchpad extensions.

### Keyboard Shortcuts
Spotlight/Quick Search
: Cmd + space

Quick Tab between Apps
: Cmd + tab

Screenshot
: Cmd + Shift + 3

Screenshot a select portion
: Cmd + Shift + 4

### Touchpad Shortcuts
Move Files
: 3 fingers + drag

## HackMD

This [markdown cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) will help your guides pop!
* HackMD [features](https://hackmd.io/s/features#Alert-Area/)
* [Markdown Syntax Reference](https://hackmd.io/c/codimd-documentation/%2F%40codimd%2Fmarkdown-syntax/)

### Adding Pictures via Markdown
![Eliot brick path](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F04HJP5HMTR/eliot-brick-path-222408.jpg?pub_secret=b3f14710a1 =400x)

> Taken August 24th, 2022. Newly installed brick path for Eliot House (because people kept walking across the grass to save 5 seconds of commute time).

To add a picture **permanently** you'll need a link to embed the image.
1. Screenshot or take the picture
2. Send the picture to **show-your-images**
3. A bot will auto-reply with the markdown for embedding the image
4. Copy + paste the markdown into HackMD

![example of markdown for embedding images](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F052CD4T94H/screenshot_2023-04-05_at_2.21.18_pm.png?pub_secret=283f117150 =400x)

* Replace **alt text** with a text alternative of what the image is. Accessibility is important! It will also serve as a marker for what the image when writing actual markdown under the hood.
* Change image size by adding " =400x" for example, after the link but before the paranthesis closes.

## Adobe Photoshop

Need inspo? --> [Cool Album Covers](https://hackmd.io/rSX9fu8wSdODJMHMeY7-mw) by LLUFS

To create an album cover of your own, you need to **find an original** to mimic first.
![Album cover of a flower head person](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F0554U448CS/screenshot_2023-04-26_at_7.31.01_pm.png?pub_secret=b00cb976a4 =550x)

Then, take a picture in a similar pose, **in front of a greenscreen**.
![Victoria in front of a greenscreen](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F0554QF2GD9/screenshot_2023-04-26_at_7.33.03_pm.png?pub_secret=4c8686b672 =550x)

1. Send the picture to #show-your-images for easy access.
2. Open up Adobe Photoshop and import your picture.
3. Mask out the greenscreen so you are left with just you.
![Victoria masked out on a white background](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F055HHYLRFT/screenshot_2023-04-26_at_7.40.38_pm.png?pub_secret=d2497972b3)
From here, it's all up to you! If you want to try something, search up a youtube tutorial! They are actually super helpful and will only get better as the years go by.

:::info
This is the end of the tutorial. Below are some examples of what I and fellow LLUFS have done.

Here's an example of what a fellow LLUF accomplished:

Another example of referencing poses:

> At first I tried mimicking this album cover, but I didn't end up liking the vibe.

Avoid using album covers that don't show your face (the point of this is that we want to see your beautiful faces :)

How to color correct the green off of me?
Maybe cycling through flowers in a gif? Maybe multiple victorias? Ask Juan how to do the painting thing he did for his album cover.

Quick Mask vs Select Subject?

### Kuleshov Effect

 The Kuleshov Effect two sequantial shots have more impact than a single shot.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OVwKItbgd3s" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    sequential shots interact/juxtapose.
       
    can manipulate time, space, reaction.
    
![image alt](https://nofilmschool.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_wide/public/kuleshoveffect.png?itok=cqbd2HMl =500x)
    
Meaning is created from the juxtaposition of individual shots.

For example, eye line shots. More emotional than factual of what the human eye can see/do.

Zooming in for instance, implies significance.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vy2Vhnqtu8I?start=35" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F04CSCYM5RV/image.png?pub_secret=67892749f9)

Meaning is created from these two shots. Shot B is what the character sees in Shot A. Shot B gives emotion to Shot A

The more cartooned something is, "the easier it is to accept discontinutities or unrealities."

## Exploring Canva
[Canva](https://www.canva.com/projects)

Old Canva Projects:

* HVC Buttons [Canva Project](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFPiK_O3M0/8VtosK9nseQYgySy21eyVQ/edit?utm_content=DAFPiK_O3M0&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)


### 4/4/23 -- Designing and making Buttons!


Want to make cool buttons such as these?

<< show buttons here>>

ITS REALLY SIMPLE TRUST ME ITS FUN -- theres a lot of words so that you know exactly what to do!

1. Open up [Canva](https://www.canva.com/projects)
2. Open [CG Button - Real Estate Flyer](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFcpGZCweM/A4XyKfsvc9QpDRWfUvK3zw/edit?utm_content=DAFcpGZCweM&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F051QTVQFBP/screenshot_2023-04-04_at_5.07.53_pm.png?pub_secret=d0e87dbc36 =300x)
3. Add page (top right)
4. Copy + Paste someone's button to the new page

![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F0526FMTSSV/screenshot_2023-04-04_at_5.11.19_pm.png?pub_secret=498979b183)

* The solid color will be cut off around the edges of the button
* The design in the middle will take up the full face of the button
* The thin line at the perimeter will be completely cut off and serves as a buffer when cutting out the button

Find images / colors you like, "open image in new tab," and click + drag it onto your page.

Double click to quick crop.

Drag the image towards the bottom right of the middle circle to snap it in.

Double click the fitted design to move it within set parameters (you can also zoom in and out to your liking).

Play around with colors and "effect" for the letters to achieve different cool things.

Once you are done, make a new page and spread out your buttons for printing (you'll want to leave enough space between them for cutting).

Download that page only as a pdf and open it up on finder. Cmd + P to print!

Now that you have your buttons printed, head over to the printer to make your button!

### making an actual button

1. Shell on shallow (sharp side DOWN)
2. Place paper on top
3. Place myler sheet on top
4. Spin around and pump
5. Back OR collet on deep (sharp side UP)
6. Spin around and pump
7. Place button on the back

use Backs for pop out buttons
use collets (circular metal with no middle) for regular buttons

Final Step: Celebrate because you just made a button! wow! super cool! amazing!

### 4-21-23 Scavanging Canva for my Projects + stuff related to Video games

This [Video Game Worksheet](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFd4o3LWl0/_8aBsorvdXsisQai9JMofA/view?utm_content=DAFd4o3LWl0&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=homepage_design_menu) was used in a class workshop for ENG VG189: Video Game Storytelling, for which I am a student of! While I didn't make this particular design, I wanted to document it as it is really helpful.

Here is an [example](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFd9K0Rzpc/tDat4jTd_MBPLE54A5Kmqw/view?utm_content=DAFd9K0Rzpc&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=homepage_design_menu) of what I made during the workshop (as a student). However, as a LLUF, I spent time going through all the games and taking screenshots of them. I also pulled some shots from the internet since I wanted to grab key moments without having to play through the whole games (which would take many hours/days).

Cool examples of how much better Canva is at conveying cool stuff than Google Slides
1. [Cool Template](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFd9D50a6c/SaVlRw1_VRj0_uddcqLKTw/view?utm_content=DAFd9D50a6c&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=homepage_design_menu)

5. [Super Cool Game on Canva?!?!](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFTi2goXpc/lH67xyVwvqVsSZFe20MGAg/view?utm_content=DAFTi2goXpc&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=homepage_design_menu)
6. [binding of issac](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFd9b4l05A/XCHyb07PdLvpcjKazS6PZQ/view?utm_content=DAFd9b4l05A&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=homepage_design_menu)


I found it!!!! My work [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFd9RpJYbA/q0jA5cbG3xeD9keDetgP0w/view?utm_content=DAFd9RpJYbA&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=homepage_design_menu)

I think all students should learn how to use Canva instead of Google Slides. When finished, I will put my finished Canva presentation here!



## Welcome Lab

### 4/5/23 -- Brainstoming Ideas for the Welcome Lab Space

#### What's Working:
* Hand Sanitizer
* Love the sign in QR code although might not be noticable at first
* Fun markers if someone needs to write something down
* candy is cool.... but...
* the wood is absolutely beautiful
* the chalk is super cool and very flexible for events! use this more


#### What's not Working! **Tissues at the front desk**
* better candy, the only good one i can see right now is the green jolly ranchers. perchance survey llufs for their fav candy. mine are crunch, kitkats
* standing desk is cool and all but i dont know if i want to stand for hours...the stools are bad for posture. how can we set up a chair with back support and the proper height for people doing welcomeLab?
* Space for people from events to put their stuff?
* TV is black... just staring back at my own reflection ): perchance we show something cool on the TV? especially during events? Like "welcome to Foo Live Event workshop!" Or showcase LLUF projects... have LLUFs design what should be on the TV?
* Lighting is okay but not conducive to fairy lights.
* hanging plants? plants? PLANT LAB?!?!?!?!?!


#### New Ideas:
* These little guys? ![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F051ZBNJ3A6/screenshot_2023-04-05_at_1.13.01_pm.png?pub_secret=e2ee362188 =200x)
* Hanging Plants ![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F051WDX8TEZ/screenshot_2023-04-05_at_1.17.27_pm.png?pub_secret=03aee6fe83 =200x)


#### Final Ideas:
* Keep candy (but survey LLUFS for their fav candy) I like crunch bars
* Keep hand sanitizer (hygiene), markers (writing things down), chalkboard (very cool)
* QR Sign in is a cool idea but not might be super noticable
* Keep the beautiful wood
* Use the chalkboard more (events, art, etc)
* Adding more plants (PlantLab?)
* Stools are bad for posture. Please add a chair with back support. Standing desk idea is cool but I'm not sure if people enjoy standing for hours.
* TV can be used to showcase LLUFS, LLUF projects, events, DYK (did you know)
* Wrapping something (fairy lights, xmas lights, vines) around the truss
* Keep desk space clean because there's not much there to begin with

- Finally finished writing up the Color Effects in After Effects tutorial! This was my first After Effects project. I found it especially fun to combine different effects to create a whole new look. I tried going into what each effect does (like the difference between brightness and contrast, saturation and vibrance) because I feel like at first it seems like they do the same thing. I ended up using transition effects to make the color effects cooler, although I didn't add that to the tutorial. I'm super excited to continue learning After Effects!

#show-your-work
- learned how to remove unwanted objects from footage using content-aware fill. It was definitely frustrating at first because  the mask came out pretty obvious, but after four attempts I'm proud of this one. One trick that helped me was feathering the mask a bit before generating the fill layer which drastically improved how the mask blended after only one layer (which is good because it takes a long time to generate one). This tutorial really helped me https://youtu.be/QBq6ZJBHABU?t=71 although it's slightly outdated (you can ask AE to automatically track the mask for you which saves a lot of time).

- finally finished the rough cut of LLUF grad essentials (ft. @Ammara Vaid) [B-roll version coming tomorrow!] She taught me some cool Premiere tricks and introduced me to Photoshop! Attached is a clip of the 4th essential (Camera) and our edited still. I learned about color correction to make bright lights less distracting and masking the camera lens to make it more reflective. I definitely want to work more with Premiere and Photoshop in the future, but I'm also interested in seeing how the workflow process is in Final Cut Pro. For my first time working in Premiere though, this is super exciting! :+1:

Reflection: 

"This week I enjoyed working with the cameras. Color grading was also pretty cool. I would be interested in helping make the notes for recording paper better. And as always, I love button making. (I'm willing to try anything new as well!)""

Reflection:

"I most enjoyed working with clay! I love building things with my hands which is something I seldom get to do in my academic life. Maybe that's why I also love button making so much. I learned how to make mirrors and bottle openers as well as working with Lightroom to grab stills, edit them into black and white, and place them into templates I made to print! I also got introduced to adobe design where I cleaned up some vector lines so that they could be printing into buttons. I enjoy both work that requires deep precision as well as free-form!""

Here's a link to a fellow LLUF's video about it. Maybe footage of me is in that general area too? [Link](https://bokcenter.slack.com/files/U02655ZC50U/F0432NWP0DS/designlab-docu.mov)
