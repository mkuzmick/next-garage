# Weekly Wrap Up Sept 23rd 2022

## Video Game Aesthetic for Showcasing Work Each Week and LLUF Progress 
* "character customization"
* things we learn = tools, 'power ups' on buttons
* video game inspired design on chalk board

## Video Ideas to showcase everything we've done each each week/this semester
* each person holds a green paper on which we impose video/photo of things we did 
* Stop motion video of llufs doing different motions that signify things's we've done for the week. By printing them out we could create physical flip books 

## learning new skills 
* potions
* tools
* resources
* skill tree

## projects
* "levels" could represent projects (for labs or otherwise) completed by the LLUF. Can start simple (ie document X cards) and advance up to more difficult (video essay, scrollytell, etc)
