# **Pierce Learning Lab Blender Notes**
## menu of things to build:
* [blender-mac-ports](/krhiE_hdSzqrauZnXpmiYQ)
## Goals
- To make neat 3d objects for PhD students presentation
- To sculpt objects and combine them
- To animate these designs so they can be presented well


## Project Designs


## Useful Tutorials
1) Sculpting with Blender For Beginners (Tutorial):

2) Making a Rasberry in Blender (Start at 5 minutes):

## Notes from Tutorials
1) **Sculpting Basics**
    - When sculpting make sure to use a mesh of an isosphere
    - Make sure it has at least 7 subdivisions (formed in creation)
    - To sculpt go to sculpting mode
    - Select your tool and click and drag
    - To invert the tool you can use control while clicking 
    - To adjust your radius you can click and modify at the top or click F and adjust
    - To adjust strength you can modify at top
    - To mirror your sculpting over an axis, click on the X, Y or Z on the top right corner next to the butterfly
    - To add more detail once you have pulled out
        - Go to Remesh in bottom corner
            - Adjust the remesh size (likely less than 0.01)
        - Go to Dyntopo in bottom corner
            - Adjust the  detail size to get more pixels with each stroke
    - Key thing to remember is that once you have completed a project go to layout mode and add the modifier Decimate to reduce the nodes, without modifying the design much.
        - This makes it much easier to send to and to 3d print

2) **Rasberry Design (Protease Notes)**
    - Not finished

## Current Project Notes
- I plan to today try and recreate a simple protease design from the HH presentation in blender with the sculpting tools
- I first will look online to see if others have designed similar things (like a raspberry)
- Watching the video for the raspberry left me very confused so I tried to jump right into it
- I created some spheres and fixed them to a circle
- I even was able to fix one to another line and the circle, but eventually moving all of the circles around started causing problems so went to designing the two circle blobs.
- Using the sculpting tool, I squeezed an isosphere into what looks like a cell dividing
- Afterwards I decimated so it could travel more easily if need be
- Notes for the future:
    - Try to combine all the shapes into one
    - Try to animate a presentation of the protease
