# binary opposition buttons for FRSEMR51R Scientific Presentation Workshop

## the course!

In this course, first-year students get hands-on research experiences and learn to deliver an engaging presentation about their research findings at the end of the course.

A key aspect of this class is students learning to work together and to get comfortable speaking in public/in front of a group.

They also learn about the importance of figures and other visualizations used to visually convey complex data. 

## the task!

The first part of this workshop will be an icebreaker activity, where students plot themselves on an XY grid with four quadrants. Each X and Y axis will have a binary opposition at each end.

We need awesome binary opposition buttons:
* each button should have one term on it (e.g., "summer" or "winter")
* include some kind of cool icon on these that visually illustrates the term on the button!

## some binary opposition ideas
* winter + summer
* morning person + night person
* sweet + savory
* urban + rural
* cat + dog
* chocolate + vanilla
* Dunkin + Starbucks
* curly fries + straight fries
* plan + improvise

anything else you can think of that would let the students have some fun plotting themselves would be awesome, too!
