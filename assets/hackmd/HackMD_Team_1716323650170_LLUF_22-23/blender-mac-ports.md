# blender-mac-ports

## the ask:
Marlon made this to scale for a studio planning thing I'm working on---If any LLUFs want to work on an intro Blender project by modeling in the ports that could be a cool thing to do during an office hrs shift this week

Here is where you can find the [blender file in slack](https://bokcenter.slack.com/archives/C042AQANH55/p1667679209376429?thread_ts=1667679167.739399&cid=C042AQANH55) (in [#3d-lab](https://bokcenter.slack.com/archives/C042AQANH55), on Nov. 5th)

and here is the [specs page](https://www.apple.com/v/mac-studio/c/images/specs/connections__ett8cnl3is8y_large_2x.jpg) with all the ports

it would also be better than nothing just to create an image texture :)
