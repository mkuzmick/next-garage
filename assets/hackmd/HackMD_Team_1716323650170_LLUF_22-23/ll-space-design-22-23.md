happy jars -- every one has a jar with their name on it. Throughout the week, LLUFs and others can drop notes about people in their happy jars. If X did a great job or made me laugh this week, I'll put a note in their happy jar saying so. At the end of the week we can go through these happy notes and recap all of the projects. 
notes can be color coded? based on content -- big up, thank you, nice memory, etc

I saved a lot of chalk pins here! Nothing on Pinterest is really exactly to my liking, but I think there are some ideas that I really like. I enjoy how chalkboard menus separate items into categories -- I think that the chalkboard wall in the LL could be used similarly for different projects. Each project is a "dish" on the "menu" with "ingredients" and "chefs" that help to complete them! I also want to create chains or ribbons or something of the like as kind of hanging bookmarks. Buttons attached to the chains are labelled with the LLUFs name as well as skills. Then we can move these chains to different projects depending on what the LLUF is working on!
