# lluf-prompt: 10 best shots of an event


## the idea, the pitch
We want to create bite-sized gorgeous media packages for the various events and projects we work on. It's awesome to have these on hand when we meet with potential faculty partners, deans, external stakeholders, etc. 

this is also a perfect learning project for anyone who is wanting to learn or practice their foundational video editing skills!

## the basic steps

### 
1. choose an event, or get one from Jordan or Madeleine. we will put the event footage onto a sdx drive ina folder named `videopackage_YourName`
2. import the event media into your video editor - see the video editor section below for your next technical steps
3. create a selects-sequence that will include all of the good stuff you might want to choose from 
4. put markers for anything you think would be a good still.
5. create a montage project and refine your selects down to the best 10 shots! Note: you may find yourself drawn to multiple themes/montage options. This is totally cool-just check with us to see which one to go with first!
6. the goal is to end up with a short montage of the 10 best shots from ths event. 
7. share with us:
    * export an xml and share to #save-your-xml
    * export the montage, it needs to be compressed to 1080p at no more that 5000 kilobits per second(or less than 10,000). You can do this in FCPX if you share to apple devies 1080p. Or export h264 with the low bit rate out of the other editors. Put the path to the file and put it on the synology
    * export a single still that can be the hero shot/tumbnail! put this in #show-your-images, grabe the .md text from the thread and put that into the work submission form when asked for 'the thing! the work! the media!'



Some things to consider conceptually as you work on this:
* There are many ways a video can tell a story through the clips that make it up. Clips can be edited from one to the next based on the progression of a story, the rhythm of the music, or the mood of the event, and more.
* In what order will you present the images? Visual arguments are constructed in building blocks, the same way that scenes in a play or moves in an argument are ordered to create a narrative: show us something. Show us something else. Then switch it up.
* How will you use pace and time to structure your argument? (Vary the length of shots in a clear way: open with longer shots, move to shorter shots, etc.)
* Use repetition to convey intentionality: a striking compositional technique used only once looks like a mistake. Repeat yourself, with gradual variation, in order to help the audience follow what you are doing. Develop motifs just as you would in an essay or a piece of music.
