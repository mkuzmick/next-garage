# lluf-prompt: AI tools 


## the idea, the pitch
You may have heard Marlon’s speech about “paving the cow paths” where Colleges in the past let the students walk across the grass and then they paved the paths that were worn down earth...well, we want to think towards paving the AI paths that we are now using to create and compose with! What AI tools are you gravitating towards right now? And importantly: How might these tools be THE tools to use for knowledge work?

## the steps

* Step 1: 
    * Pick an AI tool from [this list](https://hackmd.io/nOTyDO12SpOZExTjm6rj8Q). 
* Step 2: 
    * Screen record yourself using that app. This will help give an idea of its UI!
* Step 3: 
    * Fill out the tool's indivudal hack.md doc. 

        * Here is an [example](https://hackmd.io/nkjhC_KaRUe9Rv6pLSKIVw) of a properly filled doc
        * and here is [another one](https://hackmd.io/zMlLTsq1QICIHB5qVUe8Eg)
        * and [one more](https://hackmd.io/SAZjZn3ZTi2whNhgiQO-Bg)

* Step 4: 
    * Pay special attention to the last secrtion of the doc: the "pedgogical use case." Write a short paragraph explaining how this tool may be used effectively in an academic context. It's great if you have any ideas for assignments. 
    * For example, Rhi came up with [a cool one](https://hackmd.io/cVbc2VAeRp6mJgCqsCyk1Q) around midjourney and a WGS course!
