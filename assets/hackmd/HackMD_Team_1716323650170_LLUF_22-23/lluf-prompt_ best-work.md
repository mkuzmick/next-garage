# lluf-prompt: best-work


## the idea, the pitch
In the coming weeks, we will be working on writing up reports and telling the story of why LLUFs are so so critical to helping us innovate undergraduate education at Harvard. We want to gather some of your best works! What new skills did you pick up this year at the Learning Lab? Polish off your best work in your chosen tool and submit it using the form below.

[link for submitting your work to this prompt](https://airtable.com/shrMZUvuNlIgPffpV)

## the steps
1. gather together EVERYTHING you recall working on during your lluf time this academic year. It's cool if you can share any posts into your individual slack channel so we can experiment with it as material for coding projects this summer!
2. Choose at least 2 to polish off and refelct on. To give you some context, we will be testing out different ways to "show off" your work so we want to get some key pieces of info surrounding these best works of yours! Think about a webpage or a social media post that links to more info. we want some little bit of media that catches the eye, a title, and a description or caption as well as a longer rationale and reflection that could be a short story about this project/process. If the thing you made can be shown with a single image that's totally cool. If there's more to it (a 3D render, a video essay, a multi step graphic, etc.) then we want to make sure we can see that too. How you share that is up to you. 
3. To guide you through including all of those bits of info, please use [this form]((https://airtable.com/shrMZUvuNlIgPffpV)) (same as above) for EACH SINGLE work!


NOTE: You are not limited to only 2, please submit as many as you desire!! We will delight in anything you choose to share with us.
