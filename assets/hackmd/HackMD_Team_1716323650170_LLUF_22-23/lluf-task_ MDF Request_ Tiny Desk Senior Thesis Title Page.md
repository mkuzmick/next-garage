2. In your chosen tool (probably adobe illustrator?!) make a similar title page graphic + logo but with the following adjustments instead of "tiny desk concerts" and "from npr music":
    * Senior Thesis Colloquium
    * Harvard University Music Department


3. share the exported jpg or png to #show-your-work channel and tag @Siriana Lundgren


5. in the thread of that post share your .ai file and any external assets you used.
