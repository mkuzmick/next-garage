# montage for LP

## background:
the LL creates farewell montages for departing staff. these montages are a few minutes long (depending on how much footage can be found), ideally made up of video clips but still photos are also fine if needed, sometimes with a soundbite if there are any good ones.

## deadline:
final video needs to be ready to go by 4pm on Thursday, January 26.

## note
Luke started on October 18, 2021 - so no need to look at shoots before that day!
