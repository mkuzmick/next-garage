## Background

Students in an Expos 20 section will be perform location-specific podcasts at the end of the term, and we'll be launching this in September with an activity that has groups of 3-4 students
1. walk from their section in Sever to a location on campus and then
2. describe this location in detail into their phone's voice recorder
3. capture some environmental sound on that same phone
4. take a photo on a different phone
5. return to the LL
6. deliver a "live podcast" on our stage

We need to create the document that will be their reference during this activity

## Deliverable 

a 1-sheet (but potentially folded) paper handout for Expos20 that includes

- a map to their location
- an image of their location
- text boxes for instructions on what to do when on location
- a map back to the LL

Ps is the preferred format for image files in development, Ai for graphics, Id for layouts.

But it is also OK if you want to go with Canva, just be sure to do it in the LL Studio's Canva Pro account.

## Elements

To break down your process a little bit, here are things that will be useful for us, even in isolation (if you don't get to everything!)

- a layout (in InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator or Canva) capable of containing on one single letter or 11x17 sheet---but it can be one side, two side, bifold or trifold (or if on 11x17 feel free to do something even crazier if you know how). 
    - NOTE: ON A PROJECT LIKE THIS BE SURE TO START BY LOOKING AROUND THE INTERNET FOR GOOD PROFESSIONAL EXAMPLES. You can even create a pinterest if you want on the LL account. Like [here's one on map-centric brochures that took less than 2-minutes to make](https://www.pinterest.com/learninglabpins/lookbookbrochurewithmap/) that you can add to :)

- a stylistic choice on the map--should we just screen capture google maps? screen capture it? use a view with buildings? use a historical map?
- additional assets if required by your design (photo insert of location for instance?)
- accumulate all assets required for your design, probably including
    - image file for the map to their location
    - image file for the map to the LL (if different)
    - an image of something relevant at the locataion
    - text on the location
    - textual directions back to LL
- actually begin populating the 4 templates. Start with Mem Hall, Widener, Matthews, and Radcliffe . . . but we may need to swap others in on Monday

## Timeline

We need to print these on Tuesday afternoon, so this is a project we'll want to wrap up by 2pm on Tuesday, September 13th.
