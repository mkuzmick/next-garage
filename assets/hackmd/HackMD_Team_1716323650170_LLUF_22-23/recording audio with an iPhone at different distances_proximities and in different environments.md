# recording audio with an iPhone at different distances/proximities and in different environments

To help prep for an Expos course about interviewing, it would be amazing if someone would record themselves using a phone.

In terms of content, you can just say "Hello, it's me, [name], and I'm standing [specified number of feet] away from my iPhone in a [loud/large/small/etc.] room."

The benefit of doing this is that we can use these assets in many different workshops where students work with audio. The more we can identify the difference between these audio clips, the better! So definitely describe where you are and how far away from your phone you are in each clip!

Using your iPhone's voice memo app, record yourself speaking:
* six feet away from your iPhone in the main studio or another large/echo-y room
* four feet away from your iPhone in this same environment
* close to your iPhone in this same environment
* three feet away from your iPhone in the small studio/a recording environment that is quiet and smaller
* close to your iPhone while under a blanket (to absorb the sound)
* close to your iPhone with another person, like you're interviewing each other
    * with the phone on a table equidistant between you
    * both of you under a blanket lol (Christine and Dani might do this if we have time!)
