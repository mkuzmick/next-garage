# tool-time: Blender!
## Goals: 
- learn to select, extrude and restrict along axes 
- practice modeling spaces and objects with exact dimensions 

## Instructions: 
1. open blender! 
2. change your units to inches (on the right hand part of the screen, click on scene properties - the fifth option. go to units, change system to imperial and length to inches) 
4. add a plane to your scene (see shortcuts below) 
5. scale up your plane 
6. bring your cube up to the level of the plane 
7. go into edit mode 
8. use the extrude command to create something out of your cube - you can make a word, an object, etc. just practice fiddling with this tool and see what you can make! (read details below to learn more about how to use extrude tool if you are confused) 

finished those steps? create an exact model of something in the LL! 
1. find your object and measure it (examples of objects you could create....bookshelves, tables, etc) 
2. go back to blender. follow the same steps as before, but extrude to a particular distance/width in order to make your model. 

## Key shortcuts: 

**a = select all**
to select everything you've added to your scene select a 

**x = delete**

**shift+a = add**
blender starts with a cube by default (but if you want to try something else use shift+a to add a different shaped mesh). and by the way, a mesh is just the object you're working with (all of its verticies, edges, and faces) 

**g = grab** 
to grab and restrict movement to a particular axis, click x, y, or z (depending on what direction you want to move in) (for example, g + z will only move my object up and down)

**s = scale**
just clicking s will allow you to scale up your object or scale down. if you want to make it just taller, or wider, etc, you can use the same trick of clicking x, y, or z after s

**r = rotate**

## How to use the extrude tool
**e = extrude**
to manipulate the vertices, edges, or faces of your object you need to be in edit mode. blender defaults to object mode (see here)

you can toggle into edit mode by clicking tab or by going into the drop-down menu

note the three different options to the right of edit mode - the leftmost is vertex mode - you can use this to edit where exactly the verticies  are. the middle is edge mode, and the rightmost is face mode. 
-  so if you want to extrude a face, click on the object you're working with and click e. then move your cursor! 
-  to extrude from vertices (which is probably what you'll want to do today), you'll want to be in vertex mode. you can click and drag to multi-select vertices
    
-  to extrude a particular distance, type something like this: *e + [axis x, y, or z] + [distance]*. for example, e + x + 75 will extrude my cube 75 in. along the x axis.
