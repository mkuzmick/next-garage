# Attendance Policy


- you can always dip out of your recurring hours if something comes up, but if you want to pick up more or different hours you need to do that through event sign ups

- so your hours can still flex depending on your academic demands (we get that there will be times during the semester when you canâ€™t come in as much) we just ask that you give us as much notice as possible so we can reschedule things on our end.

- if you are **more than 15 minutes late, no-show, or cancel without valid excuse within 24 hours more than 3 times**, you will lose your recurring hours and will be limited to sign up times for the remainder of the term.
    - note: a valid excuse = your professor would accept it for missing class
