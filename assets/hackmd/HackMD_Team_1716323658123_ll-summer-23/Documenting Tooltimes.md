# Documenting Tooltimes

1. Make a hackmd file to outline the steps of the Tooltime and tag it with the corresponding lab (ex. if the Tooltime was in Illustrator, tag with graphics-lab)
3. Get footage on a drive and connect to a mac with Final Cut Pro X

3. Import footage into Final Cut Pro X and start a project:

4. Once you have selects that correspond with each step outlined in your hackmd, write them down for reference. Optional - add title slides for each select with the step name.
5. Export the selects as a single video:
    * File > Share > Apple Devices 4K
    
6. upload video to vimeo.com (signed in as studio@learninglab.xyz)
7. add links to the video to each step in the hackmd (at the corresponding timestamp)
