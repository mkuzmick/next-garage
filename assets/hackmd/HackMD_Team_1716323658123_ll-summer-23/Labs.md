# Labs


Our hope is that Labs will allow you to better connect with the work and mission of the Learning Lab by building teams and fostering an even more fun and close community here.

## CORE LABS
These Labs will be supporting courses and building public-facing prototypes. Here are the five Core Labs of which you’ll choose at least one to dock with this semester
- avLab (audio visual lab)
- codeLab (next.js, slack apps, web development, app design)
- graphicsLab (graphic design, posters, presentation visuals)
- realityLab (3D modeling and game design)
- studioLab (live event design, studio infrastructure, backstage crew)


## WHAT IT MEANS TO JOIN A LAB
Each lab is led by a returning MDF and one of our LL staff. They will set up work together times that you can sign up to attend! You are highly encouraged to come to these. Each lab will determine the details of these work together times (how often, how long, etc.)
- Be active on the lab’s slack channel:
- Read your lab’s Slack channel and respond to your labmates! 
- You are required to post a minimum of one slack contribution per week:
    - menu of types of posts that count towards this requirement:
        - a thing you made
        - a tutorial you found
        - a relevant article
- Find a way to contribute to your lab’s project(s) or course support—test activities, help out with workshops and workshop prep, build prototypes, etc. You can learn about these on your lab slack, during any lab work together times, and on the work menu board.
- Learn a tool (as many as you can/want!) associated with your lab, and make something with it. Teach it to someone else! You can do this by attending Work Events and completing Work Requests.

Each lab may have additional requirements to remain an active lab member. Your lab leads will make sure you are up to speed on these.
