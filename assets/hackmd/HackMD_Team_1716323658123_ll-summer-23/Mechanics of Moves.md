## Design Lab
these are larger group synchronous tests of multimodal activities in development. the design lab usually consists of the following components:
#### 1. a gathering and framing 

of the activity and it's context. For example, if it's to design an intro activity for a biology course with the objectives of introducing the media moves that are possible in our studio and providing an ice breaker for their group project formations, then we will explain 
   - the amount of time we ideally want the activity to take
   - the design constraints including number of students or group size
   - the learning objectives of the activity 
   - how it connects to a larger final project or course objective

#### 2. stepping into our characters/roles and trying out the activity
sometimes LLUFs, MDFs, and Staff are all role-playing as students for an activity. We also want to test it out as close to the real conditions as possible, so whoever is going to eventually lead the activity will step into the role of leader/facilitator

#### 3. stepping out of character and discussing
after we test the activity, we want to leave time for even a brief discussion to get feedback on what went well, what to adjust, what references we might want to bring in to make it more relevant, etc.

#### 4. following up for more feedback and prep assistance
we can request that llufs provide more detailed feedback

we can request that llufs help develop any student-facing materials to support the activity. 

This could be a handout with keyboard shortcuts and common steps, it could be playful guiding materials like maps or signs or buttons. 

### Here are the workflow steps for doing a design Lab: 
#### 1. propose
on slack, maybe a modal? or maybe just asking CD?
the info we want in the proposal:
- who is leading it
- a descriptive name for it
- a 2 sentence pitch for it
- context, such as succinct details on the course or larger project 
- deadline, maybe 2 weeks before the live event


#### 2. plan

- Design Lab Plan Model: 

#### 3. do
#### 4. get feedback
#### 5. refine (& optionally do again!)
#### 6. create resources

### Telephone Chain
this mechanic works well for a ton of the internal LL moves, like the name drop in blender or terminal basics
1. the lead "teaches" a ~30 minute activity to 1-2 "learners"
2. the learners have a chunk of time (depending of how the overall schedule pans out) to review and prep themselves to teach the activity.
3. they now become the "teachers" for 1-2 new "learners"
a proposed schedule:


| activity | time | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| Lead teach A     | 9:00-9:30|  
| A review    | 9:30-10:00     | 
| A teach B     | 10:00-10:30     |  
| B review    | 10:30-11:00     |  
| B teach C    | 11:00-11:30     |  

so the Lead is scheduled from 9:9:30, but ideally is around throughout the whole time to check in and nudge things

team A is scheduled from 9-10:30, and overlaps with team B scheduled from 10:-11:30

### the workflow:
#### 1. propose
#### 2. plan
#### 3. do
#### 4. get feedback
#### 5. refine (& optionally do again!)
#### 6. create resources

### Tool Time
This mechanic is perfect for a quick single move based tutorial walkthrough. It is a stand alone event that presents a great opportunity for more senior fellows to practice their teaching the name drop in blender
### the workflow:
#### 1. propose
#### 2. plan
#### 3. do
#### 4. get feedback
#### 5. refine (& optionally do again!)
#### 6. create resources

### Asynch Prompt
### the workflow:
#### 1. propose
#### 2. develop prompt
#### 3. launch
#### 4. get feedback
#### 5. refine prompt(& optionally launch again!)
#### 6. create resources
