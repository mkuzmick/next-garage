# Overview of LLUF Scheduling and Hours

## [Event Sign-ups](/K-VvzNNtSe2rJfi7VcGxSw)
As part of our design process, we gather larger groups for testing out and co-designing the various activities and workshops we are developing. And as the term progresses, we will for sure have workshops and other live events that we could use help running. As these events pop up we will add the ideal number of slots for each event as it is scheduled. This allows us to have a system of support for some of the more spontaneous needs of the LL, and it also provides both structure and flexibility for you to sign up for what interests you.
### goals: 
- To meet the highly responsive and rapidly evolving nature of the LL
- to provide structure & support for LLUFs who want to try new things, learn new skill sets, and most importantly contribute to shaping the undergraduate curriculum.
