## Overview Reflection & Feedback
Reflection is one of LLUF’s core job responsibilities. The feedback that you provide, both on the assignments you are prototyping and on your overall experience in the space, help the Learning Lab grow and learn. 

There are 5 main ways we will ask LLUFs to fulfill this responsibility:
1. per shift, a check in and check out.
2. per week, an update synthesizing their week
3. per project, a submission of what they did and a reflection on it
4. per term, a notebook that documents their process
5. on camera interviews and large group design labs

So these are basically annotated spans of time, then at certain moments we may ask you to develop a richer story around something cool you’ve done. 

### check in and check out. 
objectives: 
- to create a clock in, clock out system for attendance accountability
- to have a sense of how a LLUF is doing if we can’t physically say hi right when they arrive
- to get frequent updates on what they are working on and what they need support on

vibe check form
- let us know you’re here to work
- let us know what your vibe is (the full LL community will be able to see your vibe to help us stay connected and supportive of each others work)
- choose from a menu of work options (maybe filtered by your vibe)

check out form
- let us know you’re checking out
- let us know how things went (optional)
- did you find everything you needed to do your work? (optional)
- did you encounter any hurdles you still need help with? (optional)

### weekly update
objectives: 
- to get a time-based update that synthesizes their work over the week
- probably more on the polished side of things, something that MW can review for content and we can put into a timeline
- to get numbers for reporting (student names and services for office hours, number of things made)

weekly update form
- let us know how things are going
- what missions did you complete?
- what LPs did you complete?
- did you do any 1-1 consultations with students on course projects? if yes, what did you cover? and who were you helping?
- what’s next?
- what support do you need?
- maybe at some point we can offer a view that aggregates their vibe checks and check outs for the past week to help them recall? I could try to do this as a next app!?

for your weekly update: choose a time that you will submit that each week-it could be every tuesday, and your week goes from tuesday to tuesday-it should be whatever day feels like the best day for you to pause and take some time to reflect on your progress and work over the past week. (then maybe i can automate a slack that lists all of the shift bullets from that time period? or it’s a pinned link to a view in the log base that shows the week

### work submission
objectives:
- to center reflection and feedback in all projects that LLUFs do
- to collect specific and meaningful feedback for MDFs and Staff design process
- everything you finish that has a prompt doc get’s submitted

work submission form
- what did you learn?
- how could we make it better?
- how could it be applied to the harvard classroom?

### notebook
objectives:
- to provide a space for LLUFs to keep track of their learning (useful shortcut keys, bullets to help remember feedback when they do their work submission)
- will be in hackMD, with some creative freedoms in how to utilize it.
- will ask that LLUFs spend a reasonable ratio of work time notetaking/journaling to actually doing the thing ;)


### on camera 
objectives:
- gather media based reflections, both individual and group based

table time with marlon
- if a LLUF does something super awesome, sometimes we will schedule a sit down on camera interview with marlon

pop-up interview booth
- we will likely and often grab LLUFs for a quick reflection or “reality tv style confessional” while they’re around
- sometimes there will be a camera set up with a written prompt for you to reflect on breifly at some point during your shift.

design labs and workshop activity tests
- we hold these large group sessions for testing out ideas and pushing things over the finish line if we have an impending deadline. we almost always record them for storytelling and reports.
