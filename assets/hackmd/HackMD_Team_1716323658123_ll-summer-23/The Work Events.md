# The Work Events

## synchronous small and large group activities


If an assignment or activity needs to be tested by a group or would benefit from gathering a group for discussion, we can schedule a group to test in realtime. This might be a trial of a workshop that MDFs run or a test that LLUFs can do on their own whenever they get a certain number of people together.

We want to continuously hone the teaching and facilitation skills of our team, and we want to provide a ton of learning opportunities for our fellows to gain specific skills in the tools and media we support.

these are scheduled based on LL space and resource availability and the staff/mdf desires. 

### how to sign up for events: 
- check out the event-sign-ups google calendar and see what's on deck!
- when you click on an event, you will be able to see a description of what is planned, if there are any pre-reqs, and a list of sign up slots. So you will be able to see who else has signed up and if there are available slots.
- if there are available slots, click on the event edit button and replace "available" with your name in the description.
- please be considerate of other llufs, mdfs, and staff time by choosing a time that you are confident you can be present for. slots are limited so if you no show or are late, that is a time when another lluf probably would have liked to come in. if you need to cancel, please reach out to the lluf slack channel to see if someone else would like to take your slot. 


### who can sign-up: 
- All llufs are encouraged to sign up for these slots, even if they haven’t been around for much else
- pre-reqs: Some events may require more advanced skills sets and will be announced in relevant lab channels rather than the all lluf channel. LLUFs should use their best judgment to decide if they have the requisite skills to work that event, and reach out to the lab leads or jordan if they aren’t sure.

### types of work events:
- designLabs
- friday mdf+lluf times
- lab work together times
- workshop support
- tooltimes
- work with jk/mk time. apprenticeship model of shadow and assist us in whatever we are doing. or time for me to let a group work at ll-basics at the beginning of term, and be around to help them if they need it. but i’d also probably have it be a a recurring time when other more seasoned llufs are around to mentor them
