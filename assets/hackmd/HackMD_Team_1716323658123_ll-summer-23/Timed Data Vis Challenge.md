# Timed Data Vis Challenge

Taking inspiration from the super awesome [Dear Data project](http://www.dear-data.com/theproject/) (see [writeup here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/the-minute-data-of-everyday-life-on-52-postcards-over-52-weeks/2016/08/24/39e2b4d6-689e-11e6-ba32-5a4bf5aad4fa_story.html?utm_term=.4e143c80a1a3)), create a quick data visualization of the work you've done this past week.

## the steps
1. set a timer for 15 minutes
2. create a data vis in your tool of choice 
3. it should communicate the types of work you did (learning, prepping, testing, collecting, maintaining, etc.) and how long you spent on each type
