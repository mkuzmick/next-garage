# contentLab application plan

ideas:
* a portfolio that demonstrates what they can do in this zone is a must
    * could be external social media portfolio?
    * a photography portfolio + captions/stories
    * video essays or video assignments 
    * experience managing a social media page/marketing for a group or company 
    * motion graphics and/or other static graphics 

* selected a role/cluster of roles needed for content creation:
    * managing accounts/posting schedule 
    * concept pitching
    * video editor 
    * musical composition/loop track creation 
    * photographic essayist (ability to pull stills, color correct, and arrnage to form cohesive story)
    * graphics/designer 
    * "talent"/presenter 
    
* maybe we give them a couple of small prompts to respond to that would involve some of the common tasks they'll be asked to do
    * paper documentation
    * short video editing
    * framing an activity (either on camera or through a caption)
