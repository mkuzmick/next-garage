# designLab 20230816

## the moves these videos make
* the moves these make and how they map onto academic disciplines
* the aesthetics play a functional role 
* and might even enable you to do something even better than in academic writing
    * ex: vox chair video gives a huge number of visual tropes - more so than you could ever give in an academic essay

## chris's phone booth video example

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m5KqaERLL8w" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

* simultaneous argument + examples
* multimodal quoting
* lots of examples from films
* transitions are made easier via visuals
* costin + mayer
    * you can handle one textual stream at a time (text on a slide with prof speaking)
    * can understand multiple streams if only one is textual (so that's why visual + textual works well together)
* tons of genres, evidence (in images)
* affect (music bed)
* these things get layered and are intentional choices here
* layers and elements like we do in podcasting
    * give students the job of focusing on different elements
    * you focus on clips
    * you focus on music
    * you focus on voiceover
    * what are these things doing
* pacing of the editing
* viewer can have their own insights because general abstract theory is offered layered over a bunch of examples
    * and then you can think about what you think that scene might mean

## siriana's marvel video
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7vfqkvwW2fs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

* incorporating footage you've taken
    * and this makes the claim - no one knows what marvel film scores sound like
* something improvised about it
* lots of different perspectives brought into a kind of author's voice - because the filmed subjects are all kind of contributing to this discussion
* with sound (which is what this video is about)
    * you can't see this
    * need context for what sound is - this happens temporally
* if data you're analyzing is visual or aural, it makes sense to use a form to analyze it that aligns with those
* it's better to do this in a form that allows you to show people more stuff
* remixing the original primary source to think about how it would change on the basis of how you change the property
    * it's like an experiment
    * this piece could be good to use when we're getting students to try out different loops as they present an argument, ex.
