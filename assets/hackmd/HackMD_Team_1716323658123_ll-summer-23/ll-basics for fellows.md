# ll-basics for fellows

# LL Basics

Fellows begin with a set of onboarding challenges to orient or in the case of returning fellows, re-orient themselves to the LL. For fellows who have been around for a while can road test these modules and help us refine them, so they still have the shared experience even if they’re already familiar with a lot of this

## 3 goals

1. Ensure everyone gets LL Basic Training in a structured and systematic way
2. Give folks stuff to do as we get to know them and start to connect them to projects (and they get to know us)
3. Make sure we have headshots/bios/other website material shortly after hires and in the process make sure everyone talks on camera in their first few days


## LL-Moves
and also [Mechanics of Moves](/nkD0EnCBQlujWWxW5tsLxA)!
* take an orthographic photo with your phone to document, share, and make thinking visible
* light a subject with a softbox to take their portrait/set them up for an interview
* animate your name dropping with blender to learn blender basics and give us a cool asset
* set up a live presentation stage with the PA system and Logic Live Loops to help students have an embodied expereince of rhetorical move of "thesis dropping"
* unpack a model with the chroma key, overhead cam, cards, and brush pens to annotate a close analysis of the form
* create a playlist with spotify to augment and structre time during an event
* "to serif or sans?": design a simple font-only LL business card with adobe illustrator. (a prompt we need to update: [business card how to](/y3EfA5t7S_Kf79D2kRDIrg))
* something about REPITITION across all the labs (repitition as graphic design principle, as a vox video move-to present evidence at a volume that cannot be acheived in writing, as a music production move-repeating beats, phrases, etc.)
* maybe SAMPLING too? sampling music yes, but also sampling images and tracing them or having reference images even, sampling footage as a way of understanding i & o & e in creating a selects sequence??

## Workflow Basics
* slack on phone. the photo to slack to .md workflow.
* studio chrome profile on your machine
* basic mac shortcuts
* basic atem operations
* 

## Common questions to address:
* how do i log on to computers, ipads and apps (ex.studio google account)?
* where do i save things?
* where can i find x?
* what do i do when i come in? how can i help?
