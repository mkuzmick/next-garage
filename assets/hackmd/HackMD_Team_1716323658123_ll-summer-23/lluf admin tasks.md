# lluf admin tasks

## mk + jk

- write script for Stop Date: Shift Check-Out v. Last Updated

- add a long name, short/button name fields to WorkerProps. 

## madeleine
-   update members in hub bases
    -   update "active" and "inactive" llufs
-   as llufs sign up for Basic Training:
    -   slack:
        -   ll-undergraduate-fellows
        -   individual-channel
        -   util-img-to-md
        -   5 core lab channels
    -   create google drive folder? and link to canvas on individual channel
-   add to gcals:
        -   sign-ups calendar (TBD)
        -   LLUF Schedule
-   lluf hackMD workspace
- lluf update info form
    - jk will make form in lluf base
    - mw will monitor and add updates to central-hub as needed

## decisions
-   determine if ll-menu should hold sign-ups, or if it should be a separate cal
    - not using ll-menu anymore. llufs will have 2 dedicated calendars
-   determine if we want llufs to have drive folders
    -   talk to mk - jk not sure the protocol for saving lluf work
-   create a lluf-alum slack channel and move all past/inactive llufs to that channel
    -   #lluf-community ?? name tbd
    -   separation between #ll-undergraduate-fellows (which is only active llufs) and anyone who's been a lluf ever or who is a lluf
-   what do we want the slugs to be normalized to for llufs? my inclination is to do the same on slack as slug
