# mk-resource-setting-up-your-dev-env

these steps are for mac:

## set up your development environment

1. install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) 
`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
2. install visual studio code (`brew install visual-studio-code`)
3. install node (`brew install node`)
4. install git (`brew install git`)
5. make a `~/Development` folder to put your code in
6. create a Github account (optional: needed if you want to use Github to store and share your code and to collaborate with others)
7. (for people making nextjs apps) create a Vercel account (optional: needed if you want the simplest way to put a Next app on the web)

All of this takes a little while to do, so it definitely helps if you go ahead and do this part on your own (preferably when doing something else like watching Netflix, because you'll be spending some time waiting for some of these installs to complete).
