# project to task workflow
## project to task planning
- in the [ll-do-your-work-23-24 base, in the synced _PROJECTS table](https://airtable.com/appyJH18Xiy0Z7kD7/tblAivcXfndnkIVZ1/viwwmUcG1TvBP84Hj?blocks=hide), click the button "CreateProjectPlan"
    - this is where a hackMD book should be made for the Project Plan
    - this doc will be linked in the ProjectPlanBook field, which is a linked field to the WorkingDocs table
    - the project plan book should start with just one section/page called "Project Plan Name: Reference" or something and that page should include the info from the following airtable fields:
        - Metaprojects
        - Title
        - AssociatedMetaprojectFolder (from _PROJECTS)
        - CorrespondanceLog (from Metaprojects) (from _PROJECTS)
        - ProjectLead
        - Instructors
        - Collaborators
        - Enrollment (from _COURSES)
        - _TAGS
- then, move over to the [ProjectPlans table](https://airtable.com/appyJH18Xiy0Z7kD7/tblOkgLd9KcH1NPM6/viwqIGkslaJ8oXUKa?blocks=bipAjFY9hUDbsYy4C). 
## option 1
* in the field linking to Task Types, you could add all of the tags you wanted it to create.  and then button would create the task types according to the info below in option 2
## option 2
- you can then click on the button "CreateTasks". the extension block should then present us with a set of task options (potentially influenced by the _TYPE (from _PROJECTS, such as a google doc for meeting notes for consultation, or a workshop plan doc for a workshop), or not). we should be able to select as many tasks as we want, and then submit. then, those tasks should be added to the Tasks table, and for tasks that have have doc templates, those should be created and added to WorkingDocs table but also to the Project Book.
    - what we'd like in the task docs-
        - title of doc: Project Name - Task Title
        - link to reference doc as part of the project plan
        - lots of tags coming from the reference info 
- have to figure out
    - slug
- nice to haves
    - for lookbooks, something with Pinterest
    - 

## project launch lifecycle from earlier
* we get an email from a faculty member.
* they request a consultation.
* dani adds an appointment to the calendar.
* dani creates a metaproject and project in ll-projects-23-24
* dani needs to link the faculty member, so either they are already in _PEOPLE, or dani goes to bok whitepages. if they are there but not tagged as "LL", add LL. if they are not there, add their people record to the whitepages
* before the meeting/as emails come in, MW adds to [correspondance log](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J-wLFU1VR1a1ezlPuqRl9DMxIAL68ot5).
* dani creates a notes by day doc for the meeting with linked correspondance log
* during the meeting, dani takes notes in that doc. if they want to schedule something, dani schedules in google calendar. if it's a workshop, dani adds a new project in ll-projects-23-24 and then goes to the task base to add the related projects (ie. workshop and assign it to someone, resource development, student video recordings, etc.)
* once a workshop is scheduled, we want a workshop plan doc to be made.
* we also want the notes by day moved over to the correspondance log
* we also want a metaproject folder to be made in [LL_CENTRAL_Projects](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z-7U7xUWP73HhQ7QFw5-d7IFsk7FSFot) which then should be pasted in the "AssociatedMetaprojectFolder" in the Projects Table in the Projects base
* dani/madeleine scans calendar ahead 2 weeks to make sure we are sending check in emails before workshops
* then for these meetings, we create Meeting notes in [notes by day](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VWJSvCfn2ywvuANlDobleLXRxDtCP0Sr). after the check ins, madeleine moves notes over the correspondance log 

*where can we automate? where can we make smoother? where can dani get mw's help with some of these things?*




clients and metaprojects
and projects more towards larger course support



add consultations as individual projects
keep workshops and student recording support as separate projects
keep project plans for all of those
