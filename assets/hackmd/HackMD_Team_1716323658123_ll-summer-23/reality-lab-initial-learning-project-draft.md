# reality-lab-initial-learning-project-draft

- what is this lab?
    - Reality-lab is a curriculum that teaches the basics of blender, unity, and unreal engine. 
- some examples from the real world
    - Some examples of the uses of 3D work in the real world are architecture/construction, product design/manufacturing, entertainment/media, medical/healthcare, education/training, automotive/aerospace, gaming/VR, advertising/marketing, archaeology, interior design
- why would this be valuable in a academic / teaching and learning environment?
    - 3D modeling in an academic environment adds a dynamic and interactive dimension to learning, making it more engaging, practical, and relevant to students' lives. It equips students with valuable skills applicable to a variety of industries, preparing them for the challenges of the future workforce. It encourages visual learning, interactivity, multidimensional understanding, creative expression, real-world applications, enhanced collaboration, personalized learning, bridging theory and practice, innovation and technology integration, and inclusive education. 
- some ideas for this (things the LL has done or might want to do more of)

## The Tools

Putting together a 3D game or VR/XR experience requires many tools.


- what is the basic set of tools? (with links to LinkedIn Learning Essential Trainings for all, the actual docs, etc)
    - [Blender on LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/blender-3-3-essential-training/introducing-blender-3-3-for-beginners?u=2194065)
    - [Unity on LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/introduction-to-c-sharp-with-unity/introduction-to-unity?u=2194065) - (intro to coding in Unity)
    - [Unreal Engine on LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/unreal-essential-training-2019/real-time-visualization-with-unreal-engine-4?u=2194065) - (might be out of date because its for Unreal Engine 4)

## The Initial Learning Project
- what is the initial learning project?
    - what will I be building?
        - An annotated map with landmarks
        - A bar graph through python coding using .csv or .txt files
        - A line graph through python coding using .xlsx files
    - what tools will I be learning?
        - blender
        - python
        - sketchfab
    - what do I need to build and share? when?
        - An annotated map
        - A bar graph comparing 2 sets of data
    - some pathways (at a high level)
        - Maya/ Autodesk Products
        - Cinema 4D
        - Houdini
        - Zbrush
        - Unity
        - Unreal
    - at least one really granular step-by-step or sped-up screen capture
* lab logistics
    - the staff and mdf lead to ask questions
        - Chris and Sophie 
    - slack channel
        - ll-reality-lab

## Initial Learning Project Examples

1) An annotated map using models from sketchfab
- [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/feed)
My example:

2) A bar graph using python code
- [Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrixs_XuDQo) 
My example:
![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F05LYSN096Y/gis_dataset3.png?pub_secret=e64c82f846)
- Notes to keep in mind
    - The code will give you one set of 2D bar graphs. I used rotate and extrude to make my graph 3D.
    - Keep the data simple and build up from there. 
3) A line graph using python code
- [Youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/ATiiFTX-4K0)
My example:
![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F05MP85DXA5/line_graph_example.png?pub_secret=51f9721cb3)
- Notes to keep in mind
    - This code requires blender to have Pandas installed. The code will not work if you have Pandas installed outside of blender.
