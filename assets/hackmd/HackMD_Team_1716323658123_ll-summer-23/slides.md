# slides

the basic idea:
* design a slide template for use in presenting to the course 
* create and share .kth files (keynote templates, aka "themes")
* utilize the visual system you have determined

We will use Keynote as our main slide development tool. Once you complete your graphics-lab ILP, you can, of course, return to this component as an additional LP and do a remix using google slides, canva, or powerpoint.

## components
* visual home base
* redesign 5 slides using principles

## steps:
* close reading of model (or model + typical we provide)
    * analyze, annotate
    * compare/contrast the set of slides?
* pinterest more model decks
* identify 5 visual structures at play
* redesign 5 slides from typical using those 5 strucutres from the model deck
    * provide the typical slides, the model slides and your 5 slides.
