studio-
* foreground that when we do table - it's about isolating a move that we've just discussed on thursday (scaffolding - this becomes scaffolding for multimodal presentation they'll do in next session)
    * think in broad terms of capacities of the studio - one thing we often do is we isolate functional moves in a medium we're working with and we design an activity around that

## the story

- week 1: assignment design, learning objectives, multimodal academic communication
- week 2: the learning lab studio, learning activity design and facilitation
    - here's what you can do in the studio (with the equipment, expertise, etc)



## notes
* potentially ask senior mdfs to source new models to unpack (podcasts and video essays) - need atleast 3 takeaways/learning outcomes
    * taylor swift - style
* print things! handouts!
