        * learning goals/backward design as core to MDF role
        * why is academic writing so in alignment with what happens in these disciplines (or is it)
        * why we might be move beyond academic writing (chatGPT one reason/motivating factors)
        * and now things like games, museums easier to design with AI assistance

    * brief discussion of how AI can help with making these/what AI is capable of doing in this zone
    * tour of AI tools that can help with podcasts, video essays
    * think about question of whether AI takes on tasks that you'd want students to do (i.e., that meet learning goals) or whether AI is doing tasks you wouldn't want students to get hung up on
        * another huge zone of ai/ml is coding - are any of the science mdfs doing this?

        * list those out
        * like a music bed - you find this striking, what is it doing
    * choose your own form + unpack this form
        * what forms make sense for your discipline(s)

* 10 - 10:30
    * cd gives the prompt:
        * go to a specific station they find interesting and think about how they'd remix it for their disicpline, the form they're interested in
        * given mechanics, let's dream about what we could do with these
        * you'll learn technically about these mechanics in eventLab and toolTimes

        * list of stations
        * with rationales
        * did other groups come up with a mechanic you could use?
        * how would you use technical capacities of this studio? green screen? mics? cameras?
            * try something out!
    * rationales for these stations
        * how would you use them for assignments you've been imagining
        * what would students learn
        * what do these forms DO that would enable students to learn something profound and compelling
    * make lookbook and send to slack
        * one piece of media
        * a couple of bullet points
* 11:30 - 12 (CD)
    * share out at main table with green screen
* 12 - 1
    * lunch


you have learning objectives
they'll be in alignment with activities you construct
today will be about understanding how deep this goes
how to construct experiences where they practice those bite-sized mechanics they identify on thursday
(they can let marlon know what these are on tuesday)
how within the LL, we can construct activiteis that let students practice the moves mdfs have identified
show them some samples
get them to think about it
things can be on camera, on screens, and there are art supplies

marlon does show and tell for 30 mins
mk explains rationale for them
petting zoo of learning lab activities
I set up activity
then a break
then they assemble their menus

studio-
* foreground that when we do table - it's about isolating a move that we've just discussed on thursday (scaffolding - this becomes scaffolding for multimodal presentation they'll do in next session)
    * think in broad terms of capacities of the studio - one thing we often do is we isolate functional moves in a medium we're working with and we design an activity around that
        * round-robin 3 x 3 table with greatest hits
    * this preps them for thursday because they can use these on thursday


## thursday, august 31: live experiences (grad-facing)
* 9 - 9:30
    * coffee
* 9:30 - 10 (JK + Chris)
    * MDFs as researchers of the future who also support grads 
    * JK and Chris talk about HH support
* 10 - 10:30
    * activity: designing a grad-facing event
        * what are the challenges of presenting your research in your discipline?
        * what would your dream academic presentation look like?
        * maybe do the steve jobs talk?
            * ref'd in jk and er lab intro
        * tension to resolution and film narratives
        * then have them do this with the PA and their dissertations?
* 10:30 - 10:45 
    * break 
* 10:45 - 11:15 (CD)
    * mdfs fill out weekly update form
        * dd could say a tiny bit about what's the most helpful to know
        * or maybe does the project workflow from the mdf manual
        * visualize an arc of support for a course on the table
        * we could even make a visual timeline on the table to help make this clear
    * find and/or post media for presentation
        * slack
        * remind them about 'make it square'
        * maybe do a bit on color correction so things look amazing
    * get them in each lab channel
        * let them explore those spaces a bit
        * find something to post in a lab channel you find interesting?
* 11:15 - 11:45 (CD)
    * image + short paragraph in hackMD
    * tell the story of orientation
    * try to think about tension to resolution
        * what the tension, mystery, etc. you were trying to solve here
        * how did orientation help you solve that mystery lol 
* 11:45 - 12 (CD)
    * share out at main table using supersource
        * media + MDF on tabletop
* 12 - 1 
    * lunch


good time for mdfs to learn we sit between oue and gsas
helping grads with professional development
one of cornerstone things we do there is HH - LL helps a lot with this
gsas wants us to help us think about expanding this for grad students
events you could run for grads in their depts that are like HH or that help them with their grad experiences - g4 symposiums, graphical abstracts for their labs, explainer videos, social media presence, sharing their research


more systems things
list of basic things for them to know (access hackMD, google folders, slack)
do one myself to see how long this takes - don't want it to be rushed

## the story

- week 1: assignment design, learning objectives, multimodal academic communication
- week 2: the learning lab studio, learning activity design and facilitation
    - here's what you can do in the studio (with the equipment, expertise, etc)



## notes
* potentially ask senior mdfs to source new models to unpack (podcasts and video essays) - need atleast 3 takeaways/learning outcomes
    * taylor swift - style
* print things! handouts!
