# welcomeLab application plan

ideas:
* pre-req: be able to guide others through some ll workflow and basic moves
* maybe an in-person "audition" - maybe jessi can help design the prompt for this?

jessi audition ideas:

-- **topic oral improvisation** -- throw on the logic loops and put them on the stage with a mic. give them an LL topic (e.g. cards, workshops, buttons) and have them riff on that topic. continue to give them new topics without stopping the flow of the improvisation

-- **facial expressions** -- put them on camera (tight shot, face only) and provide them with a couple of different common "lines" they might hear from students/faculty and show (without speaking) how they would show they are listening with their facial expression 

-- **2 min MTV cribz challenge** - have them take the camera through a 2 min tour of the LL

-- **[green screen newsflash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovxm_9-JHY)** (group activity) - have one LLUF stand on the green screen and two at the main table. Key in the computer feed to fill the green screen, have a 4th party choosing youtube footage to appear on the green screen - it is important that the news anchors can see the footage but the green screen person cannot. the green screen person tries to figure out what is on the screen behind them based on clues given by the news anchors. (its demonstrated in the whose line is it anyway link)




* design a map or write up directions to the LL from your favorite spot on campus
* a quiz on LL staff and senior mdfs, matching common questions/request and tools to the person who can help
