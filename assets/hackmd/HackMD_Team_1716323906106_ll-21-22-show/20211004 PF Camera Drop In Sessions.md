## Story Title


The Bok Center encourages teachers at all levels of experience to learn more about teaching, and to become reflective about their own classroom practice. Watching someone else teach, and inviting someone else to watch you teach, are among the best ways to gain confidence in the classroom, to expand your repertoire of teaching techniques, and to become more reflective about how students might be experiencing a classroom.

There are different ways to observe, record and reflect on specific classes. At the Bok Center, we offer instructors two services—class observation and video consultation—that can help you gain a neutral, nuanced perspective on your teaching.
