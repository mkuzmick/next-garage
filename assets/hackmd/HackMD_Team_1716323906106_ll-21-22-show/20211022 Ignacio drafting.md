Danielle Duke: it's like very intense Okay, so if you can just tell me like in just a little bit about the podcasting workshop like you know why you want it to do it, or just we can just start there.

3
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.070

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.200
Danielle Duke: very formal.

7
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:36.990
Ignacio Azcueta: Okay, so i'm teaching a class it's called Spanish creative writing and it's a class that's.

8
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.230
Ignacio Azcueta: The pedagogical function with relation to the language is to serve as a bridge between.

9
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:58.410
Ignacio Azcueta: Learning and mastering the grammatical and syntactical functions of the language and just full fully diving in into cultural problems that are.

10
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:13.920
Ignacio Azcueta: dealt with in Spanish, and so this class has a little bit of both it has a strong grammatical and syntactical component and strong cultural component, the podcasting workshop.

11
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.550
Ignacio Azcueta: served as a very powerful tool to combine both.

12
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.500
Ignacio Azcueta: It was a way to have students produce a analytical and create the reflections.

13
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.160
Ignacio Azcueta: On cultural materials that had to be.

14
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:42.960
Ignacio Azcueta: Accurate in their in their execution and also in their in their pronunciation in this class usually has a lot of.

15
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.690
Ignacio Azcueta: be written component they read a lot of competitions together right they read a lot of.

16
00:01:50.280 --> 00:02:08.190
Ignacio Azcueta: of reaction type of reaction papers and they do some and they participate in class, so I can evaluate their their oral skills there, however, a podcast invites a more extended for more intervention.

17
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:18.660
Ignacio Azcueta: That that goes beyond the question and answer dynamic or the participation dynamic that you can have in a class they're actually creating very.

18
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.630
Ignacio Azcueta: Intense and.

19
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.550
So.

20
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.120
Ignacio Azcueta: Profound business of analytical writing while they're speaking, and so a boat casting.

21
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.250
Ignacio Azcueta: workshop was a great tool for that do you want to ask another question or traders can.

22
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.500
Danielle Duke: You keep talking and yeah i'll ask more, but if you have more you should.

23
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:48.600
Ignacio Azcueta: Okay, so basically what he was also built for is that these this class also takes.

24
00:02:51.210 --> 00:03:04.530
Ignacio Azcueta: and takes different it doesn't it's not structured around a single form it's not a creative writing short stories, rather we see many different forms the theater we see short stories poetry, we see.

25
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.980
Ignacio Azcueta: A little bit of commercials.

26
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:25.230
Ignacio Azcueta: And podcast was just another it's a brand new format that is very is now everywhere now everywhere is business focused and was also a good way to get students reflect on on form and so.

27
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.380
Ignacio Azcueta: Basically, what we did at the workshop.

28
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:40.800
Ignacio Azcueta: We started with them in an analytical exercise of a podcast, and this was also a great way to to get into the cultural aspect of the course because I talked a little bit about.

29
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:52.410
Ignacio Azcueta: The podcasting landscape in Spanish, and then I learned a little bit from them, or the podcast that they listen to and so introduce them to some of the biggest.

30
00:03:53.070 --> 00:04:03.720
Ignacio Azcueta: names in bulk it in Spanish, and to some podcasts that are also targeted to Spanish learners that is also an excellent tool, if we want to practice then we took a one one episode.

31
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.380
Ignacio Azcueta: Of this podcast this podcast that the world is called rally and blanton.

32
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:19.380
Ignacio Azcueta: it's a fantastic podcast produced by filing a lot of corn, which is a journalist from Columbia and we we kind of like the the miracles.

33
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:37.710
Ignacio Azcueta: Listening close reading of the podcast we deconstructed it is parts how the music works, how the voices different voices work how the setup of the of the episode was was was constructed and how the the episode continued and.

34
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:50.610
Ignacio Azcueta: With that I help I help them think through what they could do in their own in their own podcast so basically the assignment that they had we've been reading a lot of.

35
00:04:51.390 --> 00:05:05.880
Ignacio Azcueta: A lot of fiction and and the idea is that in the podcast three characters from three different works one from the theater one from a play do you want from your story.

36
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:13.770
Ignacio Azcueta: And the other one from another short story or from from a poem they will talk about the topic so basically they had to.

37
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:30.810
Ignacio Azcueta: They had to think of a topic they had to think of a good introduction for the topic they had to think on different aspects of the topic to talk about, then they had to think about a closing part for the podcast and I think it worked out pretty well i'm very happy.

38
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:38.790
Ignacio Azcueta: Actually, this week and listen to the podcast and they came out really well and they were very creative some of the way, while we were doing.

39
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:47.820
Ignacio Azcueta: The analysis I chose an episode of have a sponsor on it and they asked me well, should we build in sponsors and I talked and look without advertising there's no media so.

40
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:58.020
Ignacio Azcueta: Of course, if you want, you can you can build a sponsor so they created their own fictional companies to to advertise their and I am very i'm very happy with the results.

41
00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.270
Ignacio Azcueta: It was, it was a very that's a very.

42
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:15.870
Ignacio Azcueta: It was a very engaging forum both of creation of an evaluation, because I had to start thinking on that and aspects that they hadn't thought of before.

43
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.000
Ignacio Azcueta: When when building when when evaluating when evaluating my students.

44
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.560
Danielle Duke: What are some.

45
00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.820
Danielle Duke: Things that you like that you thought of that you hadn't thought of before when evaluating.

46
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.180
Ignacio Azcueta: um well, for example.

47
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:40.680
Ignacio Azcueta: Creativity, a lot of times has to do with imagination and invention, but here it also had to do with montage so I saw that they were very.

48
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.680
Ignacio Azcueta: They were very creative in their in their use of music and the way they.

49
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:56.040
Ignacio Azcueta: Combined the different voices that different characters and also the way they combine it in such a way that they will fulfill the task because.

50
00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.360
Ignacio Azcueta: This was, after all, an evaluation and each of them had to speak.

51
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:09.780
Ignacio Azcueta: More or less three minutes, so if one spoke like one minute, in the first part, then you will see him speaking two minutes at the end, and so it worked out pretty well.

52
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:17.010
Danielle Duke: that's awesome and you were saying that this class has like a lot of different kind of like.

53
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:27.210
Danielle Duke: pieces of text or media that is used poem fiction and stuff like that is this the first semester that podcasts have been used for this.

54
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:40.350
Ignacio Azcueta: You know, this is the second one, because they started with the podcasts I think with with courage with clean 19 we said worse, it was a good way to have students talking and.

55
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.530
Ignacio Azcueta: And it was it's the podcast that.

56
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:52.050
Ignacio Azcueta: the beauty of it is that you can mash up the different pieces of audio and each person can record it in their own home or in their own mini studio.

57
00:07:52.680 --> 00:08:11.430
Ignacio Azcueta: And so they started the the last year and well, while I was here, I thought well why don't I kick it up a notch and start like bringing students here and Kevin think more on form and see if they can build build an actual program because my my fear was that.

58
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:20.700
Ignacio Azcueta: It seems they have each of them have to speak for like three minutes, I was like I wouldn't want them to like be okay first this person speaks than this person this person speaks and that's it.

59
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:24.870
Ignacio Azcueta: I wanted them to push themselves and think Okay, think of a topic.

60
00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:34.020
Ignacio Azcueta: Think, for an episode think on how the dialogue is going to have them if there's going to be a Center build the character for the Center and they were.

61
00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:35.400
Ignacio Azcueta: They were doing really good.

62
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:36.630
Ignacio Azcueta: They really push through.

63
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:43.920
Danielle Duke: that's awesome I as you were talking to I was thinking like wow, this is a really great activity or assignment.

64
00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:57.660
Danielle Duke: That done with masks because, like it's a podcast so like you know there's there's no video whatever, and so it makes sense that you know they did start during Colvin podcast you know, like it's just it's a great assignment.

65
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:11.610
Danielle Duke: But I think even this year, while cove it is still happening we're also in masks like you're right, you were able to like have them in the learning lab like podcasts assignments still make sense, this year, but it's like it can be kicked up a notch.

66
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:15.030
Ignacio Azcueta: that's cool yeah yeah and suddenly the AC broke.

67
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.770
Ignacio Azcueta: But I had a group.

68
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.590
Ignacio Azcueta: of students lined up to report on Friday so.

69
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:28.410
Ignacio Azcueta: We went to the because they were they really liked the media lab they wanted one group wanted to record here in the studio yeah.

70
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:46.620
Ignacio Azcueta: They couldn't do it and they had to turn that in on by Tuesday, and so I told them look I don't know if by Monday, it will be fixed so work on it on the weekend sorry for that, but it will be great if this got these these classes start again to to have them to come in here.

71
00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:56.910
Danielle Duke: yeah yeah I mean if it's not a pandemic it's the H backbreaking there's thing that comes up in life, you know, like always rolling with the punches but.

72
00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:58.110
yeah.

73
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:13.950

## quotes
I had a great time working with this assignment, working here in the Lab it was very great. I would just like to mention that the workshop, it wasn't my invention, like I learned the skills to build my workshop from Marlon and from Jordan. I was mostly taking taking notes, I saw them twice do this workshop. And I took notes from them and they were super, this was super helpful, I was thinking and how to teach this, and when I saw them do this, "Oh, this is the way I have do it" and it totally made sense and it worked out perfectly. So yeah I would just like to thank both of them for their instruction and their support and well, thank everybody else, Casey who participated in the workshop with the installation of the stages, it was great.


Creativity, a lot of times has to do with imagination and invention, but here it also had to do with montage so I saw that they were very creative in their use of music and the way they combined the different voices that different characters and also the way they combined it in such a way that they will fulfill the task because this was after all, an evaluation...

The beauty of it is that you can mash up the different pieces of audio and each person can record it in their own home or in their own mini studio. And so they started that last year and well, while I was here, I thought well why don't I kick it up a notch and start bringing students here and have them think more on form and see if they can build an actual program because my fear was that since ...

That done with masks because, like it's a podcast so like you know there's there's no video whatever, and so it makes sense that you know they did start during Covid podcast you know, like it's just it's a great assignment.

But I think even this year, while covid it is still happening we're also in masks like you're right, you were able to like have them in the learning lab like podcasts assignments still make sense, this year, but it's like it can be kicked up a notch.

Media and Design Fellow Ignacio Azcueta led a podcasting workshop on Tuesday, October 12 for his class, Spanish 50: Advanced Spanish II: Creative Writing and Performance. The course first introduced a podcasting assignment during last year's fully remote school year, since each person could record separately in their own homes. Now in this time of being back on campus but masked, the podcast assignment still feels like a great fit, but with extra opportunity for it to be elevated. "I thought well why don't I kick it up a notch and start bringing students here [the Learning Lab] and have them think more on form." In the workshop, the students did a close reading of a podcast episode - they deconstructed its parts, how the music works, how the different voices work, how the setup of the of the episode was constructed and how the episode continued. Then, Ignacio helped them think through what they could do for their own podcast assignment.

While the office hours Ignacio had planned to allow groups to record their assignments in the studio ended up needing to be cancelled due to unexpected HVAC issues in the building, the flexibility that has become a trademark of being a student over the past year and a half were embraced by all, cushioned by the knowledge that students now had after the workshop's activities. Ignacio reflected on the podcasts his students submitted and the way they played with form, one of his original goals, "Creativity, a lot of times has to do with imagination and invention, but here it also had to do with montage. So I saw that they were very creative in their use of music and the way they combined the different voices, the different characters." 

Ignacio expressed appreciation for the support of the Learning Lab. "I had a great time working with this assignment, working here in the Lab. I would just like to mention that the workshop - it wasn't my invention, I learned the skills to build my workshop from Marlon and from Jordan... So yeah I would just like to thank both of them [Marlon and Jordan] for their instruction and their support. And thank everybody else, Casey who participated in the workshop with the installation of the stages, it was great."
