## PROMPT

### Paper 5: The Gallery
To approach your final gallery project, it will be helpful for you to place yourself in the following scenario:

Imagine that this class, as a group, has been charged with the task of preparing a public online exhibit of artifacts from the human past. The purpose of this exhibit (click here for the Intro Wall Text) is to introduce the world to the idea of deep human history. Your task is to curate a small gallery of digital objects that, together with those of your classmates, will comprise the overall exhibit.

Assignment Summary
Due Friday, 10 Dec.

Prepare a digital gallery, using a platform of your choosing, targeting a general audience. The gallery should feature a short text panel (200-300 words) and a minimum of 5 objects, each with brief object labels.
Write a mini-paper or brief set of comments about your gallery, ca. 2-3 paragraphs in length
Submit your presentation and mini-paper here. If your gallery is in the cloud, include a link at the top of the mini-paper. 

 Are you part of a team-based galley project? Click here.
We would like to draw many people into this exhibit, including members of the general public (friends, classmates, parents); K-12 schoolteachers and curriculum specialists; women's rights activists; philosophers of material cultural studies; behavioral psychologists who work with concepts of "natural" behavior; political scientists who study violence; tattoo artists who want to know more about the human body; members of the clergy seeking material for their sermons and homilies; activists promoting diversity and understanding; authors of fiction; game designers; and so on.
Each of you should have your own goal, defined by the particular audience you want to reach. Think carefully about your audience. Your own gallery should speak in some way to this exhibit text. But your own gallery can and should pursue your own goals as a curator. You need to devise and present a "Big Idea" that you would like to convey to your visitors.
Your gallery project should consist of two principal elements, namely, 1) a digital gallery of objects and 2) a mini-paper or brief set of comments.
1. The digital gallery is a device you will use to present the digital objects in your gallery to a general audience. It can take any form ranging from a simple Powerpoint presentation or a Prezi to more elaborate galleries drawn up in Omeka or Google Sketch-up. The digital gallery should include a minimum of five well-described, well-researched objects (some of you may want to include more than five). Formats such as Powerpoint will limit you to a linear presentation of the objects, which is appropriate for some galleries. Other galleries allow visitors to roam about in any direction. Choose a format that suits your own goals. Support is available if you would like to use more elaborate platforms such as Omeka or TimelineJS; write to Dan about this. We will also be featuring gallery technologies in a section exercise.  
Your digital gallery must include a brief text panel (several hundred words max) that introduces visitors to your objects. Each object should have a text label (several dozen words) that describes briefly (1) what it is and (2) why it matters to the gallery. The material for the text panel and the text labels can and should draw from your paper.For tips on how to write text panels and text labels, visit any of the Harvard museums and study the how curators have written up labels. This site (Links to an external site.)
offers some tips that may be useful.
2. For the mini-paper, give us an overview of your research process, describing any decisions you made as you assembled your gallery, rabbit holes that you went down and re-emerged from, objects that you considered and discarded, etc. If you are a member of a team, also use the mini-paper to outline your contributions to the gallery.
