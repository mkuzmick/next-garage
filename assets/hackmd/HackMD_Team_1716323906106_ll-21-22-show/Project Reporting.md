# Project Reporting
## Context
"Project Reporting" is a storytelling project we are trying out this year where we try to get a paragraph or two to go along with some key chunks of media, in order to help us tell some of the stories of the year. These project reports can be about Fellows' activities, workshops, and events. Short, 10-15 minute interviews to gather some information and quotes will form the raw material for the project reports.

## Steps
1. Check in with LL staff about upcoming happenings that would be good to document (and see if/how you can get involved in the media capture!).
2. Reach out to the person you'd like to set up a short interview with.
3. Slack Jordan/Katie/Dani? to set up a 15 minute zoom meeting for you and your interviewee. This meeting will automatically record to the cloud with an auto-generated transcription. (We recommend conducting interviews over Zoom so the transcription is delineated by who is speaking, making the transcription easier to sort through later.)
4. Interview!

6. LL staff will let you know when your recording and transcript are ready. Once ready, you will be sent the links to these.
7. Slack Jordan/Katie/Casey/Luke? with the date and name of the media you are looking for. Choose a few stills to include in your report.
8. Draft your report (in google docs? in HackMD?).
9. Share with Jordan!
