I want to get her working on an media-rich airtable for the audmenting-space-lab to use!! she pitched this project: "Here is what I’m thinking: I think it would be cool to make a website that have sounds embedded. However, I also still wanted to use airtable. So this is my idea. What if I made a website for a fake brand that sells clothing that when you were the clothing you can listen to the song that is ‘embedded’ in the clothing. This would allow me to use airtable as I would need to chose the songs I want to use and analyze the songs, while also using a low-code website to have sounds and songs that would be embedded into the actually website. Let me know if this all makes sense and what you think!""
