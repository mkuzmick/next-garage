* **Part 1: Metric Montage: 10 Minutes**
    * Make a Metric Montage using the clips in either the "montage" or the "footage" folders
    * Edit together 10 clips of 1 second each (24 frames)

Share what you came up with! We can walk to your computer.

* **Part 2: Rhythmic Montage: 10-15 Minutes**
    * Edit your Metric Montage into a Rhythmic Montage

Share what you came up with! 

* **Part 3: Tonal Montage: 10 minutes**
    * Go through the "Montage" footage and find a series of clips that fit a certain theme (e.g., circles). Then, make at least 10 sub-clips that fit this theme and put them in your timeline.

Share what "tone" you selected and play your clip!

* **Part 4: Clean up your Tonal Montage** so that it looks good to you. What kind of montage did you make?
