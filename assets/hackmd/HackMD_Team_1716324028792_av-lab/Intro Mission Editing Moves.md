# Intro Mission Editing Moves
### 1. Clipping & moving

A crucial part of video editing is making sure that your content looks and sounds GOOD. In my initial video, I flubbed my lines a little bit. I reset and started that section from the beginning, so in Premiere, I need to start by clipping and removing the mistake part. There is a "razor" tool in Premiere that helps you do just this. Click on the "razor" from the toolbar, and find the spot you want to cut. Cut the beginning and end of the clip. You want this to be at a natural spot, so try to find somewhere you aren't moving a lot and there is no audio. Once you have defined the boundaries of the clip(s) you want to remove, just select the clip(s) and hit Delete on your keyboard. Now, move the remainging clips close together so that the large gap created by the deleted clip is removed. The next step will help create a natural transition between these. 
### 2. Video transitions
Now that all of my content is what and where I want it to be, I want to add a transition to cover up the spot where I deleted a clip. To do this, I go to the "Effects" panel in premiere. In "Effects," there is a sub-folder drop down called "Video Transitions." I click this, and a bunch of options appear. To test them out, click and drag the effect to your clip. Try out a few of them and find one that you think looks good. For my video, I chose the "film transition," which fades my clip to black, and then fades the next clip up from black. You can shorten or lengthen the transition periods by selecting the bar inside of the timeline and dragging it longer or shorter. 

### 3. Adding music background
I want to add background music! I'm going to download a clip from YouTube -- you can use ClipGrab or 4K Video Downloader for this. Import the clip to Premiere, and drag the audio from your library into the timeline. Bam! Now you have another audio. We have to adjust the volume of the audio in order to make it background music -- otherwise it will cover up your narration. 
### 4. Adjusting audio gain
Right click on your audio in your timeline. One of the options that pop up should say "Adjust Gain" or something along those lines. Click this, and a dialog box pops up. There are a few options here; I would select "Normalize to Max peak". This means that you can change the dB of the loudest peak of the background audio, and all of the other parts will be adjusted to maintain the same ratio as the original audio. I adjust my peak to -20 dB, but try a few different levels until you find one that sounds good underneath your voice. 

### 5. Audio exponential fade/gain
You want your audio to sound good! Going from silence --> noise (and vice versa) is often really jarring to the ear, so it's a good idea to fade up and down your audio. Go back to the Effects panel, and this time go to "Audio Transitions". Here, you will find a couple of options for fading up or down your audio. For the beginning of my video, I choose exponential gain. Drag the effect to your background audio. Again, you can shorten or lengthen the effect to change the duration of the transition. For the end of my clip, I use exponential fade, and adjust. 

These are the moves I used to create my intro mission video!
