# LIGHTROOM NOTES

from 20211013, but perhaps useful even after that.

Let's log the steps.

## INSTALL

* don't forget to install lightroom **Classic** (it has more controls)
* if you are doing it for the first time, make sure to sign up for your Adobe ID with your Harvard email address to get your account working.



## INGEST

* click File => Ingest Photos and bring your photos in to Lightroom
* you'll have to select one of these three options
    * "copy" to create brand new copies of your photos in the Lightroom catalogue
    * "move" to put copies of your photos in the catalogue but REMOVE the copies of the photos in their current location
    * "add" to leave the copies in their current location but NOT make new copies (the catalogue will just have references to the files)
* you can also add metadata as you ingest (if, for instance, all the files are of the same person or event, you may wish to apply some keywords to all of the photos from that shoot)

## TAG

* give each photo a rating between 1 and 5
