# Notes on studio audio

- Options for wireless mics
    - currently all battery receivers, ideally, these would be wall-powered
    - check the Audio-Technica one we currently own

1. [Sennheiser XSW 1-825](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1387909-REG/sennheiser_xsw_1_825_dual_a_dual_vocal_set_each.html/?ap=y&ap=y&smp=y&smp=y&lsft=BI%3A514&gclid=Cj0KCQiA9OiPBhCOARIsAI0y71CLpM2rxq7Ct4zLdu4nLC7VNOcbInJNGBkEb2BDKlZwlvfU0p_zp0MaAmHQEALw_wcB)

- $529.00
- Wall powered
- 2 recievers
- Internal diversity antennas (sleeker look)
- Squelch feature (like a noise gate)
- Good investment having a dual reciever than buying individually.
- Bodypack transmitters available
- Currently use these at our church; solid

2. [Shure BLX288/PG58 Dual Channel Wireless Handheld Microphone System](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1194979-REG/shure_blx288_pg58_h9_blx288_dual_transmitter_handheld_wireless.html) 

- $549.00
- [Bodypacks available](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1194934-REG/shure_blx1_h9_blx1_bodypack_transmitter_h9l.html/?ap=y&ap=y&smp=y&smp=y&lsft=BI%3A6879&gclid=CjwKCAiAl-6PBhBCEiwAc2GOVD42HOS855Mmitx2GT6jbVVfwSW7vgxOwSSle7xt-vDnP62jOupKKBoC4mcQAvD_BwE) 
- In terms of specs, similar to Sennheiser XSW 1-825


3. [VocoPro UHF-5805-9 Professional Rechargeable 4-Channel UHF Wireless Handheld Mic System](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1496175-REG/vocopro_uhf_5805_9_rechargeable_4_channel.html)

- $689.00
- 4 recievers!  
- From experience, more likely to wear quickly than Sennheiser/Shure

4. [Shure QLXD4 Digital Wireless Receiver](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1077199-REG/shure_qlxd4_g50_qlxd4_digital_wireless_receiver.html)

- $679.00 (just the reciever)
- RECHARGABLE BODYPACKS & HH TRANSMITTERS 
- Worth-while investment
- BUT, things we'd have to get:
   - [Shure SBC200US Transmitter & Battery Charger with Power Supply](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/849151-REG/Shure_SBC200_US_DUAL_DOCKING_CHARGER_WITH.html)
   - [Shure QLXD1 Digital Wireless Bodypack Transmitter](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1077134-REG/shure_qlxd1_g50_qlxd1_wireless_bodypack_transmitter.html/?ap=y&ap=y&smp=y&smp=y&lsft=BI%3A6879&gclid=CjwKCAiAl-6PBhBCEiwAc2GOVJQVf4q4muNsQ5XioPxnt1a3ODvFOTMqRiZuH8FajfRYr48wmqpeOhoCxRoQAvD_BwE)
   - [Shure QLXD2/SM58 Digital Handheld Wireless Microphone Transmitter](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1077179-REG/shure_qlxd2_sm58_g50_qlxd2_sm58_handheld_wireless_transmitter.html)

FINAL THOUGHTS:

Either the Shure BLX288 or Sennheiser XSW 1-825 would serve well. If we're to be nit-picky (e.g. rechargable trans/rec.'s), looking into the QLXD series may be worth it.

- Options for audio mixers
    - rack mounted or otherwise
    - iso recording?
    - interfacing options?
    - multi-output options?

1. [Behringer X Air XR18 18-channel Tablet-Controlled Digital Mixer](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/XR18--behringer-by-air-xr18-tablet-controlled-digital-mixer)

- IT'S A RACK!
- $699.00
- 6 aux sends
- Auto-Mix feature (shuts open mics)
- Needs to be controlled via iPad though
- Multitrack recording available via USB

2. Zoom L12/L8?!?

- 24bit/96kHz SD card recording


3. PreSonus StudioLive AR8c Mixer

- 24bit/96kHz SD card recording

FINAL THOUGHTS:

For the work done in the studio, it makes more sense to keep the L12. Recording to an SD Card is quitessential. Besides the Model 12, there aren't really any mixers with that same functionality. 

*Note: The Behringer XR16 allows for recording to a USB stick, but only stereo recording, no multitrack. The XR18 does allow for multitrack, but to a DAW.*
*The PreSonus mixer allows for stereo recording only.*

- Options for PA systems
    - line array options? 
    - is the QSC a reasonable option for our space -- matched with a passive pair 
    - if the k8.2 is the one we want to keep, what options are there for the 125 space?

1. [Bose L1 Compact Portable Line Array System](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1547738-REG/bose_professional_774914_1100_l1_compact_wireless_package.html/?ap=y&ap=y&smp=y&smp=y&lsft=BI%3A514&gclid=Cj0KCQiA9OiPBhCOARIsAI0y71CGCiQyHwgyI2liLt6FvojEA8UiBXJSbE6gp8nnWW3ZcVnopSZXfb4aApHQEALw_wcB)

- $899.00
- Line Array (Coverage: 180° H x 40° V) (wider distribution of sound for classes/events)
- Easy to move around
- Max SPL: 112dB, **106 dB** continuous
- BUT: only 200W... would need to investigate/test dB loudness
- One up from this model is L1 Pro 8
- Can be *behind* the speaker w/o feedback, an issue too common with other speakers.
- 

2. [JBL PRX812W Powered 12" Two-Way Full-Range Main System](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1272066-REG/jbl_prx812w_12_two_way_full_range.html)

- $885.00
- MAX SPL: 150 dB
- Power: 1500W
- Coverage: 90° H x 50° V
- 

FINAL THOUGHTS: Wholeheartedly think it is worth looking into the L1 to service a wide space such as ours. If our space was more conference room style, with audience together in one area, the QSC or JBL speakers would be more than great. With students potentially being scattered around for a lesson/project, wider, equal sound coverage is vital.

- Anything cool?

### Current Gear 

- Zoom L12
  - Is recording to an SD card a necessary feature?
- QSC K8.2 (Coverage: 105°) (Max SPL: 128dB, **122dB** continuous)
- Motu 8m
- Audio-Technica System 10 Digital 2.4 GHz


~49 people fit in main studio

~2,500 sq. ft. 

### Tests to try for measurements...

- Use a decibel meter to calculate optimum loudness in studio.
