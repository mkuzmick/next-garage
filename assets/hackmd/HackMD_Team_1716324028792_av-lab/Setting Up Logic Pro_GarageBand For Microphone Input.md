# Setting Up Logic Pro/GarageBand For Microphone Input


First, open Logic Pro/GarageBand and **create a new empty project**.

When prompted to select a track type: 

- Choose **Audio** and select which input you are recieving signal from under **Audio Input**.

*Note: In GarageBand specifically, click on the microphone icon.*

Choosing which audio input will depend on where your microphone is connected on your audio interface or recording device.

- e.g. If your microphone is connected to **Insert 1** on your audio interface/recorder, **select Input 1** for *Audio Input*.

If using more than one microphone: 

- **Click on the '+' icon to add more audio tracks** with their designated input.

When you see microphone signal coming in from the level meter, you are all set!

*Note: In Logic Pro, be sure to record enable your audio tracks for recording (click the square box with the letter 'R' in the channel strip).*
