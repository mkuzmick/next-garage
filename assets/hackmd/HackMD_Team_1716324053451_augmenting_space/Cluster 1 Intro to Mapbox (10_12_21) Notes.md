# Cluster 1 Intro to Mapbox (10/12/21) Notes

* tutorial in use:
    * https://dataviztoday.com/mapbox
* challenges for future data viz endeavors/tutorials
    * downloading materials/getting log-in sorted out in advance
    * getting everyone on board about changes of plans
* potential solutions for future data viz endeavors:
    * smaller datasets to combat connection/data upload issues
    * instead of uploading data, inputting source ids into mapbox
    * centralizing all necessary info/websites in advance
* tutorial timeline:
    * uploading data challenges
    * internet connection challenges
    * location of a workaround: the source id solution
    * personal help from Zane makes a big difference in ensuring everyone gets on track with uploading the data via the source id solution
    * experimentation with styling
    * Jordan printed out at least one map to hang on the whiteboard
    * everyone screenshotted where they were at 4:35 and shared that via ll-virtual-studio!
        * see how this changes over time
    * more styling fun
    * sharing via slack!



Steps for Tutorial:
1. log into mapbox 
2. upload [dataset](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cDMKpsV_kzYgEPVOjFpv1eSmrDezBWnG)
    * in new style, layers -> add new layer -> source (non selected menu) -> add source by id -> paste source id: zwolf.ckug6xrj8019l21pgrbmik8rx-64v7u -> zoom into NYC via the search bar!
    * (this method bypasses the uploading issues + the export to tile set step)
3. style away!

Recommendations for future sites Cluster 1 can look at:
* datawrapper.de
* flourish.studio
* tableau

Next tutorial ideas:
* use data from https://www.hodp.org/data
    * involve LLUFs!
* make harvard-related maps
    * tours?
    * location data of people in a group over a certain period of time?
    *
