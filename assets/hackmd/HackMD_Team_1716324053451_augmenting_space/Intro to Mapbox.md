# Intro to Mapbox

## Prep
* Download the [data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cDMKpsV_kzYgEPVOjFpv1eSmrDezBWnG/view)
* Make an account with [mapbox studio](https://studio.mapbox.com/)
* Pick an image that you would like to use as a color palette
    * For example, I used my desktop image ![](https://i.imgur.com/cZYI3RL.png). 
        Hovering over the circles tells you whether this will be color of Land, Greenspace, Water, Roads, or Labels. 
* Optional: Bring/find a second dataset (latitute/longitude must be included) to work with after completing the first tutorial. 
    * Currently, the only dataset in the LL Basics Datasets repo with latitute and longitude, and not just country codes, is [volcano_events.csv](https://github.com/learninglab-dev/ll-basics-datasets/blob/main/volcano-events.csv). (I'll work on converting ISO codes to lat/long and adding those columns to the other datasets.) 
    * Search [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) 
    * Check out [New York City Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/)

## Outline for today

1.  Work through [Mapbox Tutorial](https://dataviztoday.com/mapbox)
2.  After completing the tutorial, take stock of how we're all feeling at this point and decide whether we'd like to 
    * Repeat tutorial with your own datset to solidify basics 
    * Choose one of the mapbox tutorials to work through 
    * Split into two groups and do both

## Alternative Steps

Instead of everyone downloading all the data, and then reuploading to mapbox studio and exporting to a tileset on their own, it is possible for only one person to host the data, make public, and for others to import the data layer using an ID.

This process would bypass steps 1-5 in the Dataviz Today tutorial, and students can jump right into step 6.
