# MK IDEAS

from Tica's awesome November 2nd challenge!

One idea = having a kind of "fingerprint" for each center showing the distribution of faculty by rank. So that at a glance you get a sense of whether the Center is entirely comprised by junior faculty, say. That's what I'm trying to do below anyway.

I was also wondering whether we could focus viewers attention a bit more when giving the map of a given center's faculty and those faculty members' research areas. We could still start with a view that has EVERYTHING visible, but a modal element could pop up (or on large screens maybe a 60% width huge sidebar say) that really pulls focus to the "visual story" of a specific center.

So in the below image I'm trying to imagine a template for a "single-center-story" . . . presumably it could also involve a relatively big chunk of text we get from the center that tells the story of what they're up to (so that we enrich the micro-narrative we get from each new click with some prose that orients us a bit)

Finally there's an idea for a streamgraph of research areas to show them over some X value. Time would be ideal if we had snapshots of the data going back decades. But if we mainly have the present then, as Claire suggested, faculty rank could serve as a proxy for time?
