## Timeline of Events
1. First, everyone had to get situated with Mapbox.
2. A number of attendees struggled with internet connection and uploading their [data](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cDMKpsV_kzYgEPVOjFpv1eSmrDezBWnG).
4. Then, Zane located a workaround: using the "Source ID" feature to upload the data. 
5. Next, Zane helped some of the attendees personally to ensure their data was uploaded.
6. Once everyone was all set up with their data in Mapbox, they were able to start experimenting with styling their maps!
7. Jordan printed out a few maps to hang on the whiteboard.
8. Everyone screenshotted their maps at 4:35 pm to send with ll-virtual-studio on Slack!
9. Attendees continued to play around with styling.
10. Lastly, attendees shared their final maps via Slack!
