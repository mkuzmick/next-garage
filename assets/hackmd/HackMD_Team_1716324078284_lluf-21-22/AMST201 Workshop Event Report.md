## Description
On Tuesday 11/2, graduate students from AMST201 stopped by the Learning Lab to familiarize themselves with the space in preparation for a 10-minute presentation they will be giving about their research papers. The students experimented with different skills in their mock presentations like using images, making eye contact with the cameras, and speaking clearly into the microphones.

## Event Purpose 
As graduate students, one of the things they are learning in this class is how to present papers at academic conferences. The main goal of this workshop is to help augment the students' perception of what an academic presentation can be. Using images and visual flairs is not meant to diverge from other academic work, instead these tools are focused on communicating ideas in a fresh, visually appealing manner. By stretching the boundaries of what a conference presentation can be, these graduate students are able to deliver more engaging presentations to their peers.
