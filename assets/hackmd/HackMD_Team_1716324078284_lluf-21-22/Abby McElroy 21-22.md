| -------- | -------- | 

   Abby has been at the LL since her First Year, during which time she developed her interests in the physical materials of our studio. During the Fall of 2021, she turned more towards theatreLab and storyLab. As with many of our LLUFs, their academic interests often influence the media and tools they choose to build skills in at the LL. Abby's academics have led her to study mindfulness and how the mind and body are connected, especially in learning. She was so excited to work with theatreLab in the Fall to develop skills around theatre-based mechanics for the classroom, including Voice and Body techniques, immersive space design, and improvisation. 
>    "We brought together our minds and bodies in order to bring theatrical techniques into the classroom. We played improv games, tested out different forms of duets, and theorized about how to create immersive spaces and how to use set design to influence behavior."

> "Every LLUF did an intro mission, which allowed them to introduce themselves, share their goals for the semester, and, learn to use one of the Learning Lab's staple tools: the overhead camera. Using overhead cameras, the AMX, green paper, cards, and more, we created stages, choreography, and scripts. While working on this, I not only learned how to use the overhead camera, I also learned how to set up a whole new station, hooking up a camera, microphone, monitor, and AMX, then adding lights to brighten the image. I really enjoyed the project, and I'm excited to do more collage work with the overhead in the future!"

> "I reported for storyLab on WOMGEN1127's visit to the Learning Lab, where they learned different tools and media they could use in their creative final projects. To learn about the workshop, I attended an evening session and watched clips of the recordings. I also marked the video and pulled stills for the report, which I edited using Adobe Illustrator. To learn about the importance of the Learning Lab for projects like these, I interviewed Marlon, then I compiled it all together into a HackMd report.
> 
> It was really cool to learn more about the rationale behind the Learning Lab and its work with classes - Marlon's explanation of how there aren't supports for creative projects in the same way that essay supports are everywhere."
