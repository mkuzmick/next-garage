# Abby's Portfolio

(aka another lovely chapter in "a massive, sprawling human epic" where she returns to the LL studio and does some amazing things.)



## Learning Philosophy Statement

A sentence or two about how you learn, and what learning is to you.

Some sentences you've written in the past that you might revisit or remix or synthesize for this statement:
*  I love to learn, something I’m sure I have in common with most of my classmates. I’ve always loved to read, and I was a really curious little kid. Somewhere along the way though, a big part of learning became about other people’s view of me -- the socialness of going to school, the approval and validation my teachers gave me, and most of all, the grades.
*  For me, school has always been inherently social on top of the academics
## Fall 2021 Works

**LLUF Intro Sequence**

Every LLUF did an intro mission, which allowed them to introduce themselves, share their goals for the semester, and, learn to use one of the Learning Lab's staple tools: the overhead camera. Using overhead cameras, the AMX, green paper, cards, and more, we created stages, choreography, and scripts. While working on this, I not only learned how to use the overhead camera, I also learned how to set up a whole new station, hooking up a camera, microphone, monitor, and AMX, then adding lights to brighten the image. I really enjoyed the project, and I'm excited to do more collage work with the overhead in the future!

**[WOMGEN1127 Report](https://https://hackmd.io/riYx3mo1RyKjN915fXHkTQ)**

I reported for storyLab on WOMGEN1127's visit to the Learning Lab, where they learned different tools and media they could use in their creative final projects. To learn about the workshop, I attended an evening session and watched clips of the recordings. I also marked the video and pulled stills for the report, which I edited using Adobe Illustrator. To learn about the importance of the Learning Lab for projects like these, I interviewed Marlon, then I compiled it all together into a HackMd report.

It was really cool to learn more about the rationale behind the Learning Lab and its work with classes - Marlon's explanation of how there aren't supports for creative projects in the same way that essay supports are everywhere.

My favorite ongoing project this year was being a part of theatreLab! We brought together our minds and bodies in order to bring theatrical techniques into the classroom. We played improv games, tested out different forms of duets, and theorized about how to create immersive spaces and how to use set design to influence behavior. I would love to continue working with theatreLab next semester!
