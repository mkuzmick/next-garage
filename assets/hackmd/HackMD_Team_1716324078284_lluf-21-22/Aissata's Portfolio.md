# Aissata's Portfolio


## Learning Philosophy Statement

To me, learning is first observing something—a move, an effect, an affect—then trying to emulate it to the best of my ability before enhancing it to meet the specfic needs of my project.



## Fall 2021 Works


[Intro Mission Sequence](https://vimeo.com/655488135)

This is my 'All About Me' video that I created at the start of the semester. I used Adobe Premiere to compile the footage together. There was a lot of planning that I did in creating my workspace and outlining what I want to say. This project helped me get familiar with the equipment in the Learning Lab, especially using the AMX, and reacclimate myself with basic functions and tools in Premiere. I am excited to continue learning how to produce different picture-in-picture/green screen configurations on the AMX and identifying which set-ups might be most useful in different circumstances.

[HTGAWM Scene Analysis](https://vimeo.com/655487201)

This is a videoessay that I made for the sculpting-time-lab. I analyze shot compositions, sound, and lightning in a scene from the first season of *How To Get Away with Murder*. I used Adobe Premiere and the voice recording app on my iPhone. Within Primiere I specfically took advantage of manipulating video duration, the Ken Burns effect, and audio transitions. From working on this, I learned the importance of being intenrional with planning audio and visual components of videoessays at the outset. I recorded my audio analysis before ever putting the visual pieces together, which made the editing process harder as I tried to make everything feel cohesive. In the future, I would love to implement more technical moves in the videoessay that include sound editing as well as adding border and graphical elements to signpost different aspects of my argument.


[StoryLab Write-up](https://hackmd.io/@llufs/SJGZerlOt)

This is a write-up I did for Dr. Gold's EXPOS 20 class. Students came to the Learning Lab with exhibits for the final research paper in mind and brainstormed the types of background information, analysis, and theoretical tools they plan on using to bring their papers to life. In my report, I specfically discuss how color-coded note cards spatially allowed students to engage with their topics more deeply as well as recognize connections between their sources. I am excited to continue exploring alternative methods of teaching and engaging with various learning schemas.
