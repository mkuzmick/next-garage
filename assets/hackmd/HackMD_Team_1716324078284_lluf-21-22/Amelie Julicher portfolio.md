## Spring Semester Recap

### Introduction
This semester I worked on a variety of different projects that allowed me to get familiar with new tools at the learning lab and a variety of programs while deepening my already existing knowledge when it comes to media and visual art. From February through May I worked with a variety of different programs that included: Adobe InDesign, Canvas, FinalCutPro, AdobeBlender and AdobeAfterEffects. Moreover, I became more familiar with  the cameras and microphones at the learning lab. in this semester recap I will be looking back on the different projects I worked on on the new tools and programms I explored and on how my learing process could be of importance when it comes to the greater Harvard community.

I mainly wanted to focus on rather moody, dark, and heavy colors such as grey, dark blue, olive, etc., to construct the feeling of a rainy day in London. The passage alludes to "low-slung concrete buildings," which is a detail I wanted to emphasize by using the concrete style backdrop. I combined two pictures in the center of my image (the picture of the train tracks and a train leaving the station). Lastly, I decided to include my paragraph as a picture of the actual book page in the bottom corner to add more texture and layers to the overall image. Lastly, I edited the image to bring all the colors together and to reinforce the colors I had in mind. This project was created with the App Canvas which allowed me to get more familiar with the App as a result. The idea of visaulizing text passages
