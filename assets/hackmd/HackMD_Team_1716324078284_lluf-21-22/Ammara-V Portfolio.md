# Ammara-V Portfolio

Hi! I'm a graduating senior that has spent the last year working and learning at the Learning Lab. In my time here, I have assisted in class workshops, prototyped assignments and activities for classes and created supporting materials for academic projects on Harvard's campus- all the while learning and developing new skills in various softwares. I can now capture footage on a range of cameras (some even just a lens, a box and some light) and edit it on multiple platforms. I can work with green screen production and audio production. I have learned techniques for reworking traditional ways of learning across subject matter. The Adobe Creative Suite is now a familiar and comfortable place. Though, perhaps the most valuable ability that I have gained from my time at the Learning Labs is the ability to teach the skills that I have learned to other students. I think the beauty of a LLUF's role at the Learning Lab is that we never stop learning and the learning never stops with us. 

### Intro Mission Statement
I started off the year making a short video and accompanying GIF to introduce myself and what I was most looking forward to for my year at the Learning Labs. This task required me to use the green screen and ATEM switcher to personalise my presentation.

## Workshops:
### French 40
#### Fall 2021: Film Techniques
French40 learners visited the Learning Lab to dissect and understand some of the filmic techniques used in the movies that they studied in class so that they could then reproduce them in their own projects. [Here](https://hackmd.io/wel0Ia6lRgS-eDKBg-sphg) is a write up of the event. 

##### Continuity Editing: 
A tutorial that I put together (*using Adobe Premiere Pro*) of Marlon explaining continuity editing as a storytelling technique.

##### Spring 2022: Camera and lighting buttons 
When the Spring 2022 cohort of French40 learners came to the Learning Labs, I helped design and make buttons for a workshop to help them visualise lighting set up configurations.

### SCRB111 workshop
Learners from SCRB111 came to the Learning Lab to workshop and present video infographics based on papers that they had read for the class. A goal of the workshop was to develop the ability to present complex scientific ideas visually and dynamically in a way that makes them easy to understand.

### ENGSCI301 Workshop
ENGSCI301 is a graduate course offered to Teaching Fellows in SEAS to help them strengthen their skills in a classroom setting. We prototyped a workshop with the ENGSCI301 teaching staff where one student (the presenter) would give a presentation based on the visuals projected onto the green screen behind them which was controlled by the presenter's partner. In various iterations, the presenter would either have a prepared presentation that had to include a surprise prop or they would have to present an impromptu speech at the behest of their partner.

### Expos20: From Homer to JayZ
I assisted LL staff in an Expos20 workshop on oral tradition and storytelling. [Here](https://hackmd.io/2fxmzlzfTzaZrxRk3VqGnw) is the event write up.

## Learning Labs:

## HDP
Here are some projects that I worked on in support of Jessi Stegall's work for the Harvard Dance Project.
#### designLab: Vogue & Reality TV 
Assuming the personas of reality TV stars (and reckoning with the spirits of made up ancestors), we conducted interviews and competed in a dance off to prototype the set up of the TDM90 dancers' introductory interviews and performances.

### Buttons of dancers for HDP
For the HDP showcase, I made buttons from headshots of the dancers taken during their performances.

### essentialsLab: montage of HDP dancers
In an essentialLab task to develop skills in *Final Cut Pro*, I used footage of the TDM90 performers to create a TV show like introductory montage. I then edited outlandish video backdrops onto the green screen behind each dancer.

### cineLab: Lookbook for HDP interviews
Fellow LLUF Charlie McNamara and I shot and compiled a lookbook of various interview locations around the Learning Labs.The look book can be accessed [here.](https://www.canva.com/design/DAE3OUURwjc/Uq7z-Wvr778sN0nqPvzaAA/view?website#2)

### essentialsLab: Scripting in Airtable
In essentialsLab, we used *Markdown* to develop ways connect the Learning Labs Slack and AirTable interfaces.

### augmenting-space-cluster: Blender tutorial 1
Learning 3D modelling using *Blender*. Here is my first stab at creating a lake monster.
![augmenting-space-cluster blender tutorial 1.png](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F03DYTEPVHB/augmenting-space-cluster_blender_tutorial_1.png?pub_secret=7b11846b95)

### data-vis-cluster: Manhattan trees visualisation:
Developing tools for representing large data sets in a visual way. Here, we created an interactive map that shows the location and condition of each tree in Manhattan.

### avLab: camera and lighting arrangement
In avLab, we learned and experimented with lighting set up configurations for applications in interviews or workshops like those used for French40.
![avLab camera and lighting arrangement.jpg](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F03E1SGHZUK/avlab_camera_and_lighting_arrangement.jpg?pub_secret=34bf7a08aa)

### avLab: lightroom workshop 
We then pulled stills from our footage and edited them in *Adobe Lightroom*.
![avLab lightroom workshop_1.JPG](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F03E54J2360/avlab_lightroom_workshop_1.jpg?pub_secret=a8071f3f93)

### paper-lab: L-shaped box model
In paper-lab, I created an L-shaped box which that could open on either end to store LL suppies. This required me to redesign existing templates so that they would meet my needs.

I started by prototyping a template that I thought might work:
![paper-lab L-shaped box prototype.jpg](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F03EEJM7F89/paper-lab_l-shaped_box_prototype.jpg?pub_secret=59d2414d06)

I then made a net for the box in *Adobe Illustrator* and scaled it to fit the specific size requirements:
![](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F03DZ2Y9NS1/paper-lab_l-shaped_box_net.jpg?pub_secret=f52607f348)

Lastly, I constructed the final product:

### paper-lab: trapeziod to fit LL cards
Given the task to ceate a paper trapezoid that can fit ~15 Learning Lab cards, I scaled up a net of a trapezoid that I found online and added in a fingerhole in *Adobe Illustrator*. 
![paper-lab trapeziod to fit LL cards](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F03E4A0B3PE/paper-lab_trapeziod_to_fit_ll_cards.jpg?pub_secret=34a5800faa)
Here is the final net:

### reality-lab: museum floor plans
Working in *Adobe Photoshop*, I edited any irregularities and distortions in museum floor plans for use in a Blender animation to demostrate the changes made to the internal structure of the museum over the years.
![reality-lab museum floor plans.jpg](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F03DMB31LDV/reality-lab_museum_floor_plans.jpg?pub_secret=a6c435a1a2)

### reality-paper-lab: museum floor plan buttons
To create a way to physically demonstrate the changes to the museum's structure, I created a button which had a sliding component that showcased the different structures around a static outline of the museum itself. Here is the final design:
![reality:paper-lab museum floor plan buttons.jpg](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F03DZ262A21/reality_paper-lab_museum_floor_plan_buttons.jpg?pub_secret=9210e6a6de)


### essay-film-lab: AFVS70 video essay
In support of Wesley Simon's work as the TF for AFVS70, LLUFs worked to prototype a potential video essay assignment that dissects and analyses a scene from a film. I edited and narrated my film essay in *Adobe Premiere Pro*.
![essay-0film-lab AFVS70 video essay.png](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F03DV95KAVC/essay-0film-lab_afvs70_video_essay.png?pub_secret=e2371835ef)


## Other Projects:
### The Mathematics of Photography
A workshop on using the various cameras in the LL studio transformed into a deeper exploration of the relationship between mathematics and photography. In one exercise, we compared "field readings" of EV using a photometer and the resulting aperture and ISO to the f-stop determined by the logarithmic relationship between these factors. The goal of this workshop was to build a deep intuition for how a camera responds to light to improve our filming skills.

### Model-dependent Realism & Buttons
A representation of atheoretical concept using buttons and colour.

### Feedback on Work, Life and Purpose GENED:
After reviewing a given case study and introductory video, I and other Learning Lab Undergraduate Fellows created a document for a professor providing a feedback on how they might develop their course materials for the proposed GENED: Work, Life and Purpose.
