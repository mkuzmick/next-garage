   Autumn is pursuing a double concetration in MCB and Government, and spent the Fall term with us as a LLUF. Autumn originally joined the Learning Lab while we were remote, so it was a great transition to in person work for her to come in and experience the physical space and resources we have to offer our fellows. She has interests in integrating data visualization, sound design, and animation.

## Tools
