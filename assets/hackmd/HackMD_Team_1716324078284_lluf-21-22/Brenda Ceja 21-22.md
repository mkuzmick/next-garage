Brenda shared this iconic portrait of [Anya-H](/BqNfO4IwQ1WZ-EH3hyfIRw) that they took during the initial corona cam field study. 

### Intro Mission
Brenda was one of the first LLUFs to complete the Intro Mission Sequence, and they even created a [Showcase Doc](/3KD7vxygQgCWcqOODzWzoA) which compiled some of the best intor sequences!

> "Hi! My name is Brenda Ceja. I use they or she pronouns. And I am a Learning Lab Undergraduate Fellow! I am a junior at Harvard College studying Folklore and Mythology, and originally from Los Angeles, California. At the Learning Lab, I am super excited to be working with AVLab, or Audiovisual Lab, and learning how to better use cameras and photography. I am also as always, excited to be assisting with the creative classroom projects happening here at the Lab.

> I believe that photography is an essential skill to teach students because it allows for new and underrepresented voices to be heard in the classroom. Traditionally, in my classes I've had to learn mostly through texts and a select number of authors shared on the syllabi. However, photography allows for students to lean into their creativity, and share the daily stories and theory that exists in the world around us. This is why I believe that photography is an invaluable skill to teach students and teachers alike. And now, with the personal cameras in our pockets, photography is even more accessible to students than ever before! This is why it's cruical we teach students proper theory about photography, and allow them to go out into the world and create. This is why I am super excited to be joining AVLab this semester, and as always, happy to be back in the Learning Lab as a LLUF!"

### storyLab projects

During one of our storyLab meetings, Brenda put their avLab skills to use and prototyped a collage story as lab logog. The challenege was to work on developing story form ideas and prototypes, and Brenda compiled their coronacam portriats and other visuals to tell the story of what avLab had been up to so far.

Brenda also took on several story assignments, including one on  [Capturing Cambridge with the Corona Cam](/nRFFPAf-QFi1bnmXSiK6Dw) as well as an [interview with MDF CLaire](https://hackmd.io/b8gea7KsS-yvBBxm9GkFIA)
