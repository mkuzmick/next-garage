##### A personal reflection:
I also had a lot of fun tinkering with the Corona Cam! It was a wonderful experience to work with my fellow LLUFs to capture pictures of each other. As the main photographer, I used my phone to capture the image that appeared on the Corona Cam. Sophie and Ayna took turns helping me by throwing a velvet curtain over my head to block out the lighting so I could get a stronger image form the beer box. 

Overall, this is the type of experiment that I would love to see in a photography class! Like Ayna, I learned about the importance of lighting and reflection. It was incredible to see our homemade camera put into action.

##### What was your takeaway from the Corona Cam adventure?
"I would say, you can use a lot of intersting household items to make your photography a lot more engaging!

##### How do you think that this applies to the classroom?
"Students can be encouraged to think more creatively with the medium they use to create art. Like making traditional art with less traditional objects.
