| -------- | -------- | 

David joined the Learning Lab this year after attending the Student Employment Fair. He brings a philosophical lens to every conversation, and pairs his skills in the realityLab and codeLab zones with a open-minded approach to projects.
   > "I learn by drawing connections between concepts, reflecting, and testing/affirming what I've learned through creating and experimenting.
> 
> Learning is growing in my ability to understand, analyze, and apply knowledge in order to create, build community, and express myself with it."

As a LLUF, David built skills around graphic design tools we use in workshops, as well as an introductory skill set in video editing.

## Tools
* canva
* FCPX

> "This is an online presentation I made detailing my first week at LLUF. I used canva to make a presentation and then format it as a website. I enjoyed playing with Canva's default tools and reviewing what I had done so far. I would like to combine my knowledge of presentation from this project with my website design knowledge from CS50, which I recently completed, to make a more complicated web design project."

## Meaning of Music Montage

> "This is a video montage of a guitarist playing an emotional song while speaking in spanish about the power of music. To creat this montage I used final cut on mac. Making the project went smoothly as I had some experience with other video editors. It taught me how learning one type of software can carry over to making it easier to learn another. I would like to try using this knowledge to edit a video essay in another program."

## Sorting Notecards

David reached out with interest in helping with some of the Studio stewardship work, and particularly enjoyed keeping the cards stocked and organized ont he black shelf. He paid special attention to creating boutique stacks of color palettes. This became useful as we often require several small stacks in a variety of cards to quickly arrange or hand out to students who attend course workshops with us.
