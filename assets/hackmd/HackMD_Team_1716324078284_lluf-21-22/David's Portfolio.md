# David's Portfolio


## Learning Philosophy Statement

I learn by drawing connections between concepts, reflecting, and testing/affirming what I've learned through creating and experimenting.

Learning is growing in my ability to understand, analyze, and apply knowledge in order to create, build community, and express myself with it.

## Fall 2021 Works
(These can be stories you've written, things you've made in labs, your intro mission sequence, etc. I gave you a sort of format to follow below)


## My First Week Presentation

This is an online presentation I made detailing my first week at LLUF. I used canva to make a presentation and then format it as a website. I enjoyed playing with Canva's default tools and reviewing what I had done so far. I would like to combine my knowledge of presentation from this project with my website design knowledge from CS50, which I recently completed, to make a more complicated web design project.

## Meaning of Music Montage

<iframe title="vimeo-player" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/655104314?h=5d04495d8c" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>)

This is a video montage of a guitarist playing an emotional song while speaking in spanish about the power of music. To creat this montage I used final cut on mac. Making the project went smoothly as I had some experience with other video editors. It taught me how learning one type of software can carry over to making it easier to learn another. I would like to try using this knowledge to edit a video essay in another program.
