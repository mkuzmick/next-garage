# Design Brief for Classroom Sound Panels

The fabrics for the panels need to be: 
1) transparent and breathable -- fabrics should be unbacked and **acoustically transparent**
    a) If a fabric is thick, plush, or has a high thread count, it is likely NOT acoustically transparent
    b) you should be able to breathe through it without resistance and see lightly clearly through it 
3) functional -- need to be able to be pulled tight without losing their shape or ripping 
4) aesthic -- acrylic and polyester are good choices, as are 50% polyester blends

**One caveat** - while this fabric is VERY inexpensive (less than $4/yard), it may make the most sense to buy a small amount and try it out to see how it affects sound absorption before covering all of the panels.

To cover the panels, we could likely just staple or hot glue the fabric in place.
