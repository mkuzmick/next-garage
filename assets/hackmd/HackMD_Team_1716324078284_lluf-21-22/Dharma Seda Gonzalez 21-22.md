As a way of building skills for documentary filmmaking, from capturing footage to editing, Dharma set out to create a project that interviewed some of our current LLUFs. This gave her the opportunity to go through the entire process in a bite-sized way. 

> "Going into the summer before my senior year, I plan to collect similar interview footage of elders and young people in Barcelona, which was the heart of many queer countercultural movements. Some of the questions that I asked here (ie. what do you remember from the first time you came to the Learning Lab) will be applicable to the broader themes of historical memory that I will broach in my thesis."
