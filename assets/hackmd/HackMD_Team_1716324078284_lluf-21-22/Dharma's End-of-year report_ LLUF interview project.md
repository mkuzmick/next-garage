### Inteview Questions


* Do you rememeber the first time you came to the Learning Lab? How did it feel to enter the space, and what was the first project you were excited about?
* Are there any gaps/absences/missing pieces here at Harvard (ie. things you would like to change)? How can we use art/tech/ideas/play to fix them? 
* What is unique about the Learning Lab, and what gaps does it fill within the Harvard Bubble?
* What projects are you excited to work on in the future, and how have your experiences at the Learning Lab prepared you to take them on?


### Setup ideas

* Window-side of Learning Lab (camera set-up), subject is focused in on, with Learning Lab space, bookshelves, tech, etc in the background. 

### Final Project

### Reflections

* Going into the summer before my senior year, I plan to collect similar interview footage of elders and young people in Barcelona, which was the heart of many queer countercultural movements. Some of the questions that I asked here (ie. what do you *remember* from the first time you came to the Learning Lab) will be applicable to the broader themes of historical memory that I will broach in my thesis.
