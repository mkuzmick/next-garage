# EXPOS20 Loyalty and Betrayal BEAT Analysis Workshop

By Marc Courtemanche


## Description 

On Tuesday 11/16, students from Expos20: Loyalty and Betrayal worked through a series of stations in the Learning Lab to further develop ideas for their final papers. From the BEAT framework, groups combined forces to find common themes across their separate ideas. Carefully examining each aspect of their BEAT outlines allowed the students to ensure their outline was clear, concise, and innovative. From peer-review to a mini workshop using cards, the main goal of the workshop was to "get to a different modality of thinking" about their papers. As a deliverable, groups developed a short presentation for the end of class that synthesized a theme with a visual component - whether it be LEGO figures or chess pieces!


## Purpose 

Focusing on the lateral connections between their papers serves to enrich each individual students' understanding of their own work. Understanding a concept means being able to recognize it in many forms. The Expos20 students began to access that deeper level of comprehension as they progressed through the workshop. Splicing their proposal into its BEAT components and analyzing each as a stand alone piece strengthens their arguments. Furthermore, being able to grasp how each source contributes to the larger picture pushes students to be critical of the stability of their paper. Using the presentations as a mixed media step on the way to their final papers gives the students creative facility over their ideas and helps build a strong foundation for the rest of their research.
