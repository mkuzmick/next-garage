  Joining us as a LLUF towards the end of this year, Emma is doing a double concentration in Earth and Planetary Sciences & Computer Science, and comes to the Learning Lab with skills in theatre lighting design and tech. She is particularly interested in building skills in the photo and video editing zone. So far, she has begun learning about photo/vidoe capture with our cameras, and gained familiarity with the interfaces of FCPX and blender.
