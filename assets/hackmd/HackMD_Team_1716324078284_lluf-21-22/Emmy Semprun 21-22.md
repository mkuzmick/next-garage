   Emmy has been a LLUF for several years and specializes on collaborative projects in support of courses. She has been an integral part of the Learning Lab's support of GENED 1080: Engineering the Acoustical World. Under the mentorship of MDF David, she created student facing guides for in-class activities. David reflects, "Her talent was creating clear, simple summaries of how abstract mathematical concepts connect to the musical side of the course, and related, developing short and engaging activities that reinforce a particular music-engineering concept. On collaborating with her, it also stands out that no matter the task, her attitude was always positive and energetic, and she always met deadlines, communicated her progress, and seemed focused and dedicated to the task. "

### GENED1080 In Class Activity Revamp
The goal of the in-class activities revamp was to break up the traditional lecture-style class, allow for peer discussion of class topics and provide a measure of student progress/understanding of the lecture material. The previous activities were on desmos and learning catalytics and we moved them onto poll everywhere in the process of revising them. Emmy helped to reframe the materials to make them more engaging for the students.

### graphicsLab projects
Emmy helped to create and revise several print and web materials for LLUF recruitment!
