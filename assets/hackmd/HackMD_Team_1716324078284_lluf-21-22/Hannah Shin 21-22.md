Hannah is a Neurobiology concentrator who holds a keen interest in audio and visual based tools. She joined the Learning Lab in Spring of 2022 and has worked on building skills in Adobe Indesign and Unity. She also created one of the most broadly shared student facing guides of the term that goes through the steps of creating a student developer pack and gaining access to canva pro.

> "I chose “Borges y yo” which is a passage I thought was super cool from a Spanish class I took (original Spanish version and English translation) and an image of streets of buenos aires in “Borges y yo”"

### get canva pro student guide
> "I refined  “how to access canva pro” hackmd page using GitHub and added some last steps. It was a bit of a tedious process to get there :cat_typing:, but cool that we can get a free year of canva pro using our student email! :cat_jam: Here’s the link: https://hackmd.io/G-7a-EOuTA6hj464CuhdQQ?view"


### realityLab essentials: annotated 3D object
