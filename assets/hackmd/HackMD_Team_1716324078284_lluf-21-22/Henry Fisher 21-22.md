| -------- | -------- | -------- |

Henry, a First-Year, joined the Learning Lab this Fall after a conversation at the Music Department with MDF David. David reccommended he apply, and brought him in to the studio for a quick tour and intro to our team. Henry brings many of the qualities that we value in our community-namely an enthusiam for unconventional forms of learning and communication. Henry is doing the Harvard-Berklee dual degree and is thinking of also doing a double concentration in English and Computer Science. 

>    "I am a new LLUF. I am really interested in music and how it makes us feel. How can we begin to understand melody, harmony, and rhythm in a way that feels limitless and exciting— in a way that helps us express ourselves? I hope to be able to get other people excited about music here at the Learning Lab, whether that’s through making video essays, interactive programs, or something else entirely. Really excited to be working here!

>    I really like the idea that all of the instruments, cables, and wires will never give you the idea you want to express- that has to come from inside. At the same time, Eno says that these instruments can change the way we think and go about creation. I think the ultimate goal of what we do in the learning lab when we learn a new piece of technology is not the learning of the technology, but getting to express ourselves in a novel way. For instance, when we learn blender, the ultimate takeaway is not the knowledge of blender, but the new methods of creativity we are teaching our brain. In line with that, [here’s a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emXYPRlVBas) where a lot of thought and experimentation clearly went into the “technology” of the song (i.e. the percussion, and the recording of that percussion), but it still wasn’t the point of the song — it was all to serve a greater purpose of emotional expression."

### intro mission sequence

Henry and [Autumn-D](/Q3O-OcCeQP2Mhew2pCRjEg) worked together to learn the skills required to complete this year's intro mission for LLUFs, intended to orient them to a set of priority tools in the studio this year.

### avLab testing

Being back in person meant restocking and updating our studio equippment in preparation fo rthe varisou workshops we'd be hosting throughout the year. For all of our podcasting, video editing, music, and other events that are audio-based, we needed to get a set of headphones. When we needed to decide on which headphones to purchase, Henry stepped up as a passionate audio tester. He tried out our various headphones and provided feedback on which set seemed best to get.
> "I listened to music on all of the prospective headphones. My favorite were the grey and green ones.  Out of all of them, they weren’t the most comfortable, but the sound quality was definitely the best -- every instrument in the mix was really clear, whereas the other headphones felt a bit rumbly."

Henry worked with David to give feedback and brainstorm music realted assignments for GENED1080: Enginneering the Acoustical World
> "This was a very productive and fun semester for me at the Learning Lab. I ended the previous semester with some beta-testing of a music assignment for GENED 1080. In this particular assignment, students were assigned to look at a pair of songs involved in an intellectual property lawsuit – that is, one song that plagiarized another song, according to a court of law. They were assigned to gure out just what exactly made the songs similar. I compared two songs that had similar melodies, and I schematized a “detective algorithm” that would automatically detect whether two songs have similar melodies."

> "Early in the second semester, I participated in the “geo-text lab,” wherein students combine geographic information with textual information to represent ideas in new ways. My assignment was to express the atmosphere of a place in a literary work, by combining a quotation from the work with an image and map of the place. I took an excerpt from the poem “Paul’s Case,” wherein the titular narrator takes a romantic drive down a wintry Fifth Avenue in New York City. I took a few creative liberties, coloring in a downtown NYC map and adding some special eects using Photoshop. This was the result:"

> "This is the passage I am using for geo-text-lab-- taken from Paul’s Case, by Willa Cather. This is one of my favorite passages from any short story! It feels so romantic (as in romanticism) and makes me feel a vivid combination of nostalgia, excitement, and winter mellowness, even though it uses such an extremely specific setting and level of detail."

> "Soon we began Essentials Lab, where a group of my fellow LLUFs and I brainstormed the imaginary GENED course “Cities, Power, and the Built Landscape.” We got to work, generating ideas for intermedial capstone projects we might craft as nal projects for the course. I settled on the idea of an interactive 3D cross-section of an oce building. A user would be able to scroll around the annotated oor plan, exploring how each part of the building plays a role in real estate prices / business hierarchy / power in general. You can read more about it in my project proposal below, which takes the format of a magazine spread. I created it using Adobe Illustrator, emulating the template of a furniture magazine I found on Pinterest:"

### realityLab essentials: annotated 3D object

> "I then prototyped my Essentials Lab project by creating an annotated 3D model in Blender. I downloaded an oce building 3D model from online, and added 3D text annotations. I added a creative air by putting these annotations within the actual building, as if they were giant neon signs that were part of the architecture itself. I also learned how to program a virtual camera to follow a path around my Blender building, circling it to output a video that showcases the project from 360 degrees. Here are a few rendered images of the project."
