# Image-geo-text-prototype-mission MARCUS KNOKE

I've decided to use Elizabeth Bishop's poem *Arrival at Santos* for this project. [This is the link to the poem. ](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57361/arrival-at-santos) Here is the poem in its entirety. 

*Here is a coast; here is a harbor;
here, after a meager diet of horizon, is some scenery;
impractically shaped and—who knows?—self-pitying mountains,
sad and harsh beneath their frivolous greenery,*

*with a little church on top of one. And warehouses,
some of them painted a feeble pink, or blue,
and some tall, uncertain palms. Oh, tourist,
is this how this country is going to answer you*

*and your immodest demands for a different world,
and a better life, and complete comprehension
of both at last, and immediately,
after eighteen days of suspension?*

*Finish your breakfast. The tender is coming,
a strange and ancient craft, flying a strange and brilliant rag.
So that's the flag. I never saw it before.
I somehow never thought of there being a flag,*

*but of course there was, all along. And coins, I presume,
and paper money; they remain to be seen.
And gingerly now we climb down the ladder backward,
myself and a fellow passenger named Miss Breen,*

*descending into the midst of twenty-six freighters
waiting to be loaded with green coffee beans.
Please, boy, do be more careful with that boat hook!
Watch out! Oh! It has caught Miss Breen's*

*skirt! There! Miss Breen is about seventy,
a retired police lieutenant, six feet tall,
with beautiful bright blue eyes and a kind expression.
Her home, when she is at home, is in Glens Fall*

*s, New York. There. We are settled.
The customs officials will speak English, we hope,
and leave us our bourbon and cigarettes.
Ports are necessities, like postage stamps, or soap,*

*but they seldom seem to care what impression they make,
or, like this, only attempt, since it does not matter,
the unassertive colors of soap, or postage stamps—
wasting away like the former, slipping the way the latter*

*do when we mail the letters we wrote on the boat,
either because the glue here is very inferior
or because of the heat. We leave Santos at once;
we are driving to the interior.*

This poem focuses on the themes of interiority and exteriority, and how these things are in tension throughout the poem. Bishop is a traveler, and writes travel stories to make money. At this point, her poetry is not quite as popular as her travel writings. She is reflecting on her role as a tourist, someone who always exists on the outside, even as she travls deeper and deeper inside. 

This is reflected by her travels from the coastal city of Santos, where she has arrived, to her eventual departure for Sao Paulo. I want to create something that reflects this journey, from a coastal city to an urban center. Here are a few videos that I might want to use for my project. I'm still unclear about the format I am going to select, but I think that I will do something in Premiere with videos.

Here is an analysis of the poem that I found really helpful in building my understanding. [Outside Santos](https://confluence.gallatin.nyu.edu/context/interdisciplinary-seminar/outside-santos?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=outside-santos). 

I'm not really sure how I am going to go about this project, especially considering the geodata aspect. I've never worked with geodata before and am unsure about how to proceed from here. Can you include geodata in a video?

ideas: 
- google earth and after effects -- zoom in and out along the bus ride to include mapped geodata in a video
- google earth studio?

there are a few mentions of material objects in stanza 5 -- coins, paper money, flags. would be good to include these references in the video. 

I think that I want to narrate the poem as the video progresses? Or overlay screenshots of the text. caption style?
postage stamps and soap -- necessities
mailing the letters before they leave -- that's a really important moment i think. 

The majority of the poem is actually spent at the port: https://www.portodesantos.com.br/en/about-us/

A video I made on Google Earth Studio with their in-program animation. I definitely want to play around with this application more. 

I also tried to use Unity for this project, as I had found a Google Maps Unity Assets package for download. I tried it out, but it seemed like it wasn't going to meet my creative needs. It was made for 2-dimensional game play which wasn't super useful to me.

Google Earth Studio has a YouTube channels, and they have posted tutorials there! Here are a few playlists that I found helpful:
