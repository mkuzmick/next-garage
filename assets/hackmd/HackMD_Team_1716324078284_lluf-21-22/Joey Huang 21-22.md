| -------- | -------- | 

Joey found the Learning Lab through his Expository Writing course on Reading Museums. He joined the Learning Lab this Spring, and quickly put his prior skills to use. As a Computer Science concentrator and a photographer for the Crimson, Joey's intersection of interests align well with the work that LLUFs do. We connected him with some projects in both the code and reality zones, and he got along swimmingly with them. Probably the most exciting project Joey helped with this year was in developing assets for Harvard Horizons visuals. His skills in blender were so quickly demonstrated, that he even helped to staff some of the realityLab open studios towards the end of the term!

### realityLab: learning Blender
Joey came in with some previous experience in 3D modeling programs like Autodesk, Maya, and Solidworks. In order to help us with some of the projects in realityLab, He needed to become fairly quickly acquainted with Blender, the program that we primarily use in the LL this year. 
![monkeywithhat.png](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F034S37T1QS/monkeywithhat.png?pub_secret=931f366cd3) We often find that pairing a relativly lighthearted subject with the more complex tool interaces leads to a pleasing and bite-sized learning experience that gives students a chance to get comfortablye with the tool interface. Many of our LLUFs go for the intro Blender donut tutorial, but Joey stretched into a slightly more intricate subject with this santa monkey. Doing this quick intro tutorial gave Joey the foundational knowledge with Blender to dive into some of the more relevant and urgent asks of realityLab this Spring.

### realityLab: Blender Camera Movement Tutorial

Joey went on to share his newfound Blender knowledge with other fellows by creating this [Blender Camera Movement Tutorial](https://hackmd.io/HOH9szcPSzCxP7lPJJyUrQ)

### Harvard Horizon's visual prototypes and asset development

Joey began by creating some [prototypes as options for Karina's abstract networks.](https://hackmd.io/aHSh4J6KSnaXuBWFCiCkBw)

> "My (revised) idea was to have a shape that rolls and distorts, and the lines (Iâ€™m thinking of maybe using more metallic-looking shapes, like tubes) emitting out of them being related to the semantics"


Here in his first modeling, we can see his idea taking shape:

He also helped to model and animate a 3D globe for Hannah's Arup Museum visual.

Marlon shared this gif of the final product, thanking Joey for "doing the hard part."

### codeLab bot work
With Marlon's guidance, Joey worked on a few features of our slack bots, namely the show-your-work bot. He even worked on getting ffmpeg running on a heroku server to autogenerate gifs from videos less than 10 seconds long.
