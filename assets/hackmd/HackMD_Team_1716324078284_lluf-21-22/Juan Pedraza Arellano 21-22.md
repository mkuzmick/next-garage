   Juan recently became a LLUF later on in the Spring term of 2022, and dove right into our community with bursting enthusiasm

Juan helped Bok Staff create buttons for their programming, and learned the studio tech and process for making Buttons from live stills capture, photo editing scripts, and slack to airtable workflows.

### 5 Essentials Video

Juan worked with [Victoria Wijerathnayapa](/Chpwh9XjTeSktaAoQbrrwQ) to learn how to edit a video of Ammara explaining her 5 essential LLUF tools. This video will ultimately be part of the LLUF orientation package. They also created this tutorial for future fellows: [project-edit-LLUF-5-essential-Tools](/nW-0CBC5RmGO_NiTWlZLIg)

### Studio Stewardship: Shelf Organizing
![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F03G7P8U0RZ/image_from_ios.jpg?pub_secret=742528fe92)
Often when LLUFs have an extra 15 minutes or so during their shift, we ask them to help keep our studio space in its most magical state-sparkling, clean, and organized--with all of our materials, supplies, and tools easily accessible and visually parseable. Juan did just that with the one area on our studio that consistently becomes a bit more disorganized than others--the far right black shelf!

### studio stewardship: button station
![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F03EW5L4BD4/image_from_ios.jpg?pub_secret=d2767cf49f)Juan worked together with [Caleb Lee](/XrGJx-9YQiubHm57IY-bjQ) to organize and conduct inventory on our button station.
