   Karina joined the Learning Lab as a LLUF for the Fall semester, during the transitional period that paused regular Undergraduate Pedagogy Fellows work. Given Karina's interest and skill set around DEI work, she began planning a UPF documentary project around student expereinces during the pandemic. For her time at the LL, she focused on gaining some of the technical skills rewuired for her project, namely those around video capture, cameras, and lighting equippment. She is interested in data visualizations and documentary film as a format for storytelling and academic communication.

## Tools
* Atem
