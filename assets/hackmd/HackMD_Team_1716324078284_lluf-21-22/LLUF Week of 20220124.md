# LLUF Week of 20220124

Welcome back! We hope your holiday break was lovely and we are excited for your return to the LL! We are following Harvard's protocols around returning to in person activities. So this week, we understand that many of you may need to work some remote shifts (although of course we would be delighted to see you in person!). Starting next week, we will ask that you work in person. As always, reach out to us on your individual slack channel with any questions. 

We will have more information coming at you over the next week about specfics for the rest of Spring term. But for this week, here's what you need to know:

All work this week will be asynchronous missions. We have linked the prompts for these missions below. 

**One super important thing to note:** To contribute to our visual storytelling of the LL, we are requiring (but hopefully it will be more fun than annoying for you!) you to [**SHOW-YOUR-WORK!**](/2pMQFrT5ScmihdRndYTz9w)(<-- check out this link for all the info!):
* ***at least*** every SHIFT: post in [#show-your-work](https://bokcenter.slack.com/archives/C02T7LNCD6C)
* ***at least*** once a week: post in [#show-and-tell](https://bokcenter.slack.com/archives/C02SJ00USMR)

So, please make sure you adhere to (and have fun with!) this as you work this week! We are all really excited to see what you come up with! And totally reach out as you work (and Jordan will try to check in during your shift) to help make sure this all makes sense and goes well for you!
