# LLUF Week of 20220131

## First off, some highlights from last week! 

<iframe src="https://ll-timeline-machine.herokuapp.com/show/customview/ShowYourImages/JK_LLUF_WEEKLY" width="100%" height="800px" frameborder="2"></iframe>


a GIANT THANK YOU to Marcus, Michael, Charlie, Anya, Ammara, and David for being the first LLUFs to test this out!  Some insights we learned from last week's show-your-work posts:
* for now, if we want to include your awesome updates in a timeline, it looks like the media that's best to post in show-your-work is a png or a gif. 
* There were some cool videos and links posted too though and hopefully we can find a way to include those in a cool way in the future (note: any coders out there, get in touch!) 
* But maybe for now, if you post a link or video, you could also post a screenshot of it somehow?
* Also! You may notice that the "Titles" in the timeline are sometimes less than ideal...so! If you want to help make them better, then be sure to rename the image/gif file before posting to slack!

From those of you who did the comic-spread-prototype: Wow! Ya'll made some amazing spreads! Also, thanks for posting links to resources and relevant articles. You rock! 

Charlie was the fearless solo shorthand-prototyper last week and really did some stellar trailblazing for anyone who wants to try this next week. Our main focus for those interested will be to develop and refine some student-facing guides, as well as get your shorthand skills honed just enough to help with potential office ours or help requests from students.

## Important Info!
**One super important thing to note:** We need everyone to contribute to our visual storytelling of the LL, so we are requiring (but hopefully it will be more fun than annoying for you!) you to [**SHOW-YOUR-WORK!**](/2pMQFrT5ScmihdRndYTz9w)(<-- check out this link for all the info!):
* ***at least*** every SHIFT: post in [#show-your-work](https://bokcenter.slack.com/archives/C02T7LNCD6C)
* ***at least*** once a week: post in [#show-and-tell](https://bokcenter.slack.com/archives/C02SJ00USMR)

So, please make sure you adhere to (and have fun with!) this as you work this week! We are all really excited to see what you come up with! And totally reach out as you work (and Jordan will try to check in during your shift) to help make sure this all makes sense and goes well for you!

Starting this week, we are excited to see all of you in person for your shifts. As always, reach out to us on your individual slack channel with any questions. We know that things shift quickly during the beginning of the term, and want to do our best to support your work and excitement around LLUFing!

The Spring LLUF Manual is now live! It has quite a few links out to other important info so be sure to explore it thoroughly and reach out with any thoughts or questions that arise.
