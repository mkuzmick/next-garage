# LLUF Week of 20220207

## Last Weeks Highlights: 

<iframe src="https://ll-timeline-machine.herokuapp.com/show/customview/ShowYourImages/JK_LLUF_WEEKLY" width="100%" height="800px" frameborder="2"></iframe>


a GIANT THANK YOU to Marcus, Michael, Charlie, Anya, Ammara, and David for being the first LLUFs to test this out!  Some insights we learned from last week's show-your-work posts:
* for now, if we want to include your awesome updates in a timeline, it looks like the media that's best to post in show-your-work is a png or a gif. 
* There were some cool videos and links posted too though and hopefully we can find a way to include those in a cool way in the future (note: any coders out there, get in touch!) 
* But maybe for now, if you post a link or video, you could also post a screenshot of it somehow?
* Also! You may notice that the "Titles" in the timeline are sometimes less than ideal...so! If you want to help make them better, then be sure to rename the image/gif file before posting to slack!

From those of you who did the comic-spread-prototype: Wow! Ya'll made some amazing spreads! Also, thanks for posting links to resources and relevant articles. You rock! 

Charlie was the fearless solo shorthand-prototyper last week and really did some stellar trailblazing for anyone who wants to try this next week. Our main focus for those interested will be to develop and refine some student-facing guides, as well as get your shorthand skills honed just enough to help with potential office ours or help requests from students.

## Important Info!
**when posting to [**SHOW-YOUR-WORK!**](/2pMQFrT5ScmihdRndYTz9w):** 
1.  IMAGES!! = an image (or gif!). If you are posting a link, then post a screenshot of the most visually interesting thing you found at that link, and then inlude the link in your caption. And if you are posting a video, same thing--find a still to share and also post the link to the video.
2.  Title = please rename your image file before posting to slack, becasue whatever it is becomes the title for your image, and it would be way cooler to have descriptive and fun titles!
3.  caption = in the message with the image file, include a short caption that explains what we are looking at! 
4.  post to show-your-work ***at least*** every SHIFT...and the more posts, the better!



### *When you finish a mission, or ***at least*** once a week (whichever comes first!): post in [#show-and-tell](https://bokcenter.slack.com/archives/C02SJ00USMR)*
