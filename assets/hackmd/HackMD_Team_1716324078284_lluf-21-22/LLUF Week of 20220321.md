# LLUF Week of 20220321

## Welcome back from spring break!

Oh wow! The LL is certainly not the same without you all around!! WE HAVE MISSED YOU! 

We also know that for many of you,the last 2-3 weeks have been a lot. And this has meant that you haven't been able to come in as much--we support you, and encourage you to do what's best for you to balance you academic + social + LLUF time. Jordan will be reaching out in your channels to check in and see where you are at with things, and to discuss what to focus on during your time at the LL for the next couple of weeks. 



## essentialsLab
We are now entering the realityLab module!!! The tool of focus for the next 2 weeks will be blender. The making goal is to annotate an object in the 3D space. I am SO excited to get started on this and to see what we all learn and make!

We are also :crossed_fingers: hoping to get as many of your layouts as possible shared and documented:

* [graphicsLab prototype](https://hackmd.io/yS3Yq_t_RnWhKnBJ-LLxpw). PRINT IT OUT! :smile: When you post to show-and-tell, please include a super brief reflection on how you used some graphic design principles and the tool Adobe Indesign to create a visually compelling project proposal for your capstone project.
