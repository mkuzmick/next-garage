# LLUF Week of 20220328




## essentialsLab
We are in the realityLab module!!! This week is your working week to build (or import) and annotate an object in the 3D space.  Develop your skills in blender, render that object, and help us come up with various ways to connect objects in 3D spce and text. This could be rendering the object and then bringing it into adobe Indesign to incorporate it into a  layout. It could include adding 3D textual annotations in space and rendering out a short movie or gif.

THE KEY IS TO MAKE THE WORK LOOK GOOD! Reach out to us for feedback! Post in show-your-work! Let us help you!

One other goal of this week is to get as many of you into learning and trying out different camera movements within blender. See the blender-cam mission below for more details!!
