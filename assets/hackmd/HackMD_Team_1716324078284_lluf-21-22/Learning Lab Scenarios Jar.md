# Learning Lab Scenarios Jar
Hey all! Next time you're in the lab, be sure to check out and **add a card or two** to our lovely ~Learning Lab Scenarios Jar~ (name pending -- Slack us some fun name ideas)!

One challenge we've been facing in TheatreLab is in coming up with example scenarios to try out methodologies we're experimenting with. Producing scenarios relevent to the actual happenings in the learning lab tends to take up more time than we'd like. We've learned this to be a challenge faced by other labs as well, and so we thought it would be worth pursuing this potential solution: the Learning Lab Scenarios Jar! (name pending)

We're filling this jar with **common situations, scenarios, and contexts that take place in the Learning Lab**. These will be used as fun, relevant prompts to work off of when practicing technical skills and experimenting with tools and methodologies. For example, if we'd like to workshop storyboarding, we can grab a card from the jar, then create a quick storyboard based off of the card's scenario!

The Learning Lab Scenarios Jar lives on our **studio bookshelf**, next to our Newspaper Column.

We'd love if you could take a minute to add a few cards about what scenarios you typically encounter, or see others encounter in the Learning Lab! Some **sample scenarios**  that have already been included are:
* Performing an intro-mission-sequence
* Explaining one current or past LL-Lab project
* Teaching someone how to work a camera
* Giving a tour of the Learning Lab
* Describing the role of an MDF


If you don't plan on being in the Learning Lab soon but would like to add something to the jar, feel free to add it below and we can pop it in for you!
