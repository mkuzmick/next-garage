   Marc is pursuing a joint concentration in Applied Math / Economics with a secondary in the HAA department. Marc is also involved with the radio station, is on the ultimate frisbee team, and plays the bass. He found out about the Learning Lab at the SEO Job Fair and joined us as a LLUF shortly after. It quickly became apparent that Marc learns quickly and loves to write, so we set him up with storyLab and he became a prolific reporter!
