Marcus is a Sophomore who spent their entire First Year as a remote LLUF. We were so excited to see what they would create in person with us this year. Marcus brings an artistic sensibility to every project they work on, and is a great example of how valuable including the students' perspectives in our design process can really shape our course support in a positive way.

## Works

### avLab 

In the Fall, Marcus was very involved with [avLab](/b2XUQoszSUOPL2dCmVNpiQ), and worked on several bite sized projects to build skills with cameras, lenses, adobe lightroom, and more!

Marcus worked on the [Capturing Cambridge with the Corona Cam](/nRFFPAf-QFi1bnmXSiK6Dw) project and took this awesome portrait of [Aissata](/yr-v3y5DTBS5hlLSgH2wOQ)

During avLab with Marlon, marcus learned global edits and creative color correcting in adobe lightroom, and demonstrated their new skills by editing a portrait of [Abby-M](/0c8qbwWkQdC0jb9IqDOOng) to make her jean jacket green.

### Intro Mission 

![Marcus's Sneak Peak](https://i.imgur.com/ufRfMkx.gif)
Marcus went beyond simply learning the technology and creating an [ Intro Missions ](/3KD7vxygQgCWcqOODzWzoA) intro sequence to writing up a document of ["editing moves"](https://hackmd.io/VHjcxLyRRn6fvgXAXjpbFA) they made during the process!

### Transcription

> "Hello! My name is Marcus, and I use he/him and they/them pronouns. I'm a Learning Lab Undergraduate Fellow, or a LLUF! I am currently a sophomore in Currier House from Madison, Wisconsin, and I'm studying English and Women, Gender, and Sexuality studies. At the Learning Lab, I am most interested in reality and people's interpretation of reality. Everyone has their own interpretation of what they think the world looks like according to their point of view and the story that they have had in their life so far. And so, to understand all of these different interpretations of reality, I like to participate in avLab, or audio-visual lab, as well as using 3D modelling tools such as Unity and Blender. I think that a major problem in classrooms in the United States and around the world right now is ignorance. There is a lot of ignorance to other people's narratives and other people's realties as we often think of ourselves as the only one with a correct interpretation of reality, when in actuality, each and every one of us has a unique perspective on the world around us. And so, I think that we can use the tools that I learn here at the Learning Lab in order to help people visualize and understand other people's versions of reality. For example, you can create a 3D model of a village or a town or a city, even, inside of a Unity program, and allow people, through a computer screen, to actually walk through a model of a place that they would never be able to travel to in real life. I think giving people the tools to express their own interpretation of reality and making sure that people listen to and understand this perspective in a way that values both the narratives of the person who is telling the story and the person who is listening is the best way that we can combat ignorance in our classrooms and in our education systems. To finish, I would like to read a stanza from one of my favorite poems, Song of Myself, by Walt Whitman. On line 58, Whitman writes, "Welcome is every organ and attribute, of me, and of any man / hearty and clean / Not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and none shall be / less familiar than the rest." If we can give people the tools to find themselves intimately familiar with their peers and fellow classmates, we can work to eliminate ignorance from the classroom and focus on creating an environment of visualization, realization, and understanding. I'm super excited to be doing work this semester with the Learning Lab!"

### HIST1206 Workshop Assistance
Marcus joined in on the MDF cluster [Illustrating-Ideas-Cluster](/kX9p_XSFSV-kcRSlc-dAag) during the fall and worked on several projects that the MDFs were building their pedagogy around. When [History Media & Design Fellow - Claire Adams](/B1WNCC8jTKqCkFJ7eurSSw)   developed a workshop on Reinterpretation of a Paris '68 Poster or Photograph for HIST1206, Marcus was eager to help run one of the stations on printmaking. With a strong physical art practice, they were a perfect choice to help students learn the basics of carving, inking, and printing elements for their posters.  

### Comic Prototype

![Comic-100.jpg](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F032251ARMW/comic-100.jpg?pub_secret=f3bee3d779)
[The comic spread prototype project](https://hackmd.io/D27SUVILRPiuLeeAv0OD7Q) developed towards the end of Fall term in the illustrating-ideas-cluster, and became one of the Learning Lab's January prototype build sprints. Marcus joined in and created a two page spread. They even wrote [a student-facing guide](https://hackmd.io/_0pAN2iuSXGngBsb_OmQIg) for future courses or workshops.

### realityLab essentials: annotate a 3D object
> "working with Blender to make some Dracula objects. Here is a screen recording of what I have right now. What I want to do: add textures/sculpt the plane to make it look more like land (and spookier??), add more text for the object annotations, add another object (wooden stake) to complete the trilogy of objects and the narrative, anything else?"
