# Notes on Cluster 1 Meeting 11/16/21

* accessing the commented data in Appendix A must be done by opening the HackMD file and accessing the "Edit" view once you're logged in; I had to go to the augmenting-space-lab section in HackMD to get it (could be a hurdle if this tutorial is given to a group without HackMD accounts)
* suggestion: change the "city.eu" copy so that users don't think "city.eu" is the name of the data point, rather than "d.eu"
* could add have the JS code in a code snippet rather than an image to make it easier to copy-and-paste (if that's something you want people to be able to do from a pedagogical perspective)
