# Reading Scientific Papers Feedback

## Video 1 Summary

LLUFS overwhelmingly found the first speaker clear and understandable and thought he spoke at a good pace. That being said, they thought there could be some changes to make the video more engaging and helpful. While they appreciated the speaker's response to how he gets ready to read an academic paper (preparing with highlighters and a delicious drink), they wished he had spoken more about the academic process to best understand and engage with the arguments and information. 

Additionally, many students mentioned the possibility of bringing in more humor or color (via cards, animations, etc) to the interview because it is a slightly drier, more academic topic already. That being said, some students found the backdrop and tone to be fitting.

## Video 1 Questions & Response Breakdowns

### How do you like the speed the guest speaks?
- Too Slow x3
- Good x7

Two students noted that the speed would be good if the pauses and do-overs were edited out
        
### How do you feel about the length of the guest’s answer to each question?
- Good x5
- Too Long x5

###  Is the guest’s answer clear and understandable?
- Yes x10

###  Do you find the guest’s answer helpful for you in terms of reading papers?
- No x10

People generally noted that they expected to learn more about the academic process of approaching a paper, rather than the personal habits. While they appreciated both, they wanted more structured questions to prepare the viewer for each topic.

###  Do you like the style of this interview?
- Yes x4
- No x5

There were a few ideas for ways to tweak the style. First, students liked the idea of making the question asking consistent (either with an outside voice asking, or the person reading the question, or on cards, or an edited text in the video). People also suggested bringing in animations or cards to bring some more color and energy into a slightly more serious topic.
    
        
## Video 2 Summary

Overall, students really liked this video (even more than the first one!). They thought the pace was good, the speaker was clear and understandable, and the content was really helpful to them in understanding academic papers! Students had a lot of suggestions re: style, including emphasizing the stucture of how different academics approach different papers, giving speakers an actual paper to dissect, and adding subtitles and an option to change the video speed.

 ### How do you feel about the length of the guest's answer to each question?
- Too long x4

###  Do you like the style of this interview?
- Yes x3
- No x2

Students really liked that different types of academics (different levels, different fields, etc) were being asked the same questions. They suggested that maybe the video series could really intentionally and explicitly structure in this way, so the viewers would see the different ways they answered. Some also thought it could be interesting for the speakers to dissect an actual paper. Another suggestion was to have multiple academics in conversation with each other in one video.
