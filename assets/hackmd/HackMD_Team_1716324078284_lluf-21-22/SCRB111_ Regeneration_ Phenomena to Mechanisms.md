# SCRB111: Regeneration: Phenomena to Mechanisms

TF, Carlos Rivera-Lopez, criveralopez@fas.harvard.edu

Enrollment: 11 students


## Course Description:
How can some animals regenerate large pieces of their bodies following injury?  This course will use both classical and current primary literature to explore the fascinating process of regeneration across phyla, covering both invertebrates and vertebrates.  Through a combination of minimalist lectures, robust discussion, and student-led presentations, students will learn to distill questions into specific, key experiments; to design experiments with meaningful controls; and to use data to refine, reformulate, and develop new hypotheses. 
Students will be engaged in group work throughout the semester. They will develop new Wikipedia pages about specific topics related to regeneration. As a final project, they will write and produce short videos centered on student-selected topics, and the course will culminate with a class-wide viewing event.
