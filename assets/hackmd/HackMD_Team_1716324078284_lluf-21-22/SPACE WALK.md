# SPACE WALK

## DESIGN CHALLENGES AND IDEAS

* activity should involve photos at locations
* we want to come away with a bunch of photos that have latitude and longitude in the exif data
* we'll write a script that grabs lat and long and student (or other stuff that's relevant) and then use this to programmatically generate the map
* we need to motivate it by connecting it to some sort of content that could conceivably be part of a Harvard College course
* should we have a simultaneous video shooting element?
* potential course content
    * Primitive Navigation-style activity that will create interesting spread between the data points (i.e. walk for 10 minutes due west from X and take a photo, or, separated by enough time not to see each other, walk from X to Y)
    * something that maps Harvard experiences meaningfully, like a place where you experienced X, or your favorite place to do X, or the first X sort of place you encountered
        * ideally there's something meaningful in the location alone, and in the clustering of locations that we get from this
    * way-finding
        * take a way-finding map and get to X, then Y, then Z, taking photos every ____
* mem hall stories maybe?

### IDEAS FOR JORDAN

* Harvard Lore
    * One of the semester-long projects in GenEd 1097 (aka 'Tradition, Performance, and Culture' aka 'Intro to Folklore') is the compilation of a set of items of "HarvardLore". Each student is responsible for documenting fifteen items, which can be Harvard-centric superstitions, legends, jokes, rituals, etc. Students are encouraged to approach anyone who might be the holder of such knowledge - fellow students, d-hall workers, building managers, Deans, department admins - anyone - to get items for their collections. 
    * We were brainstorming over the summer a bit and thought it could be intriguing to show off some of these items on a dedicated website. With student permission, we could overlay the items on a map of Harvard's campus, and so create a sort of "tour" of HarvardLore. While they aren't required to collect images, geo-tagged images would be especially helpful for a site like this.
    * A LOT of the items we get are very building specific, and I'd imagine there's a good chance the LLUFs will have already know a lot of the stories we're collecting. To start off, here are some buildings or landmarks which come up frequently:
        * Johnston Gate
        * The John Harvard statue
        * Widener
        * River Houses (for the River Run)
        * Holden Chapel
        * Dunster House (usually related to its ghost)
        * But ANY location can be rich in local traditions
    * NB: I know Lowell Brower, also in folklore, has been leading spooky campus tours for his currently running course "Supernatural Storytelling: Ghost-lore, Occult Legends, and the Politics of the Paranormal" - long term he might also like something like this!
    
* Architectural History
    * document building elements that document a specific era
    * split map view, one of harvard campus, and if you click on the data point/location, a global map on the right lights up with origination of style(s) found in the harvard building? 
    * react/coding lab - architecture texture guessing game


## DRAFT PROMPT

Today we're going to play with a couple of mechanics:

* selfie-video story-telling
* geo-tagged selfie-photos to get location
* database generation from media
* visualization of airtable records holding lat and long info

And we're going to do so by connecting to a couple of projects MDFs have recommended

* the Harvard Lore project that Elizabeth mentioned Folklore and Mythology being interested in
* a classic intro Architecture Class assignment Taylor from the GSD pitched

So here are the steps

1. everyone meets Jordan at Cambridge Common
2. all get a prompt
3. go collect photos
4. return and debrief
