   Sharleen spent the Fall term primarily supporting theatreLab. Her schedule was unique in that her availability aligned with MDF Jessi's preparation time for theatreLab. While Sharleen was unfortunately unable to attend the group lab meetings, she collaborated closely with Jessi to brainstorm and shape activities and workshop ideas. Sharleen's enthusiatic and optimistic sensibilties create imaginative and playful collaborations--perfect for offering feedback to learning experiences rooted in theatre mechanics.

### Intro-Mission-Sequence

#### [ Sharleen's Intro Mission Sequence Video](https://https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js)
![Sharleen's sneak peek](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F02H7DPMBR9/lohsharleen_intromissionsequence_gif.gif?pub_secret=87f146afcc)

The intro-mission-sequence was a great example of learning technical skills through my own project! By following Jordan's [tutorial](https://https://hackmd.io/ZSRcI0I-RcK0KGhOyxjhoQ), I learned how to construct a performance to introduce myself and capture it using tools like the cameras and ATEM Software.

One of my favorite parts of this project (and the Moves of Immersion workshop) was being able to help both develop the tutorial and participate in the final project. By helping Jessi and Jordan workshop the TheaterLab portion of "devising a performance" for the intro-mission-sequence, I was able to delve deeper into thinking about and playing around with specific aspects of video performance, like how our body, hands, and props should enter/exit the frame, and how we can move elements within the frame to best highlight the story we are telling.

Although my final video is far from perfect, I had a lot of fun playing around with creative uses of the space within the video frame and green sheet frame, like layering and wiping off cards from the green sheet. When filming my takes, I realized that my perfectionism was making filming take forever, especially since there were so many performative aspects to think about at the same time! I ended up recording the video and its audio separately, and timing them together afterwards, but I'll keep working on improving my comfort with performing live.

Learning how to use the key tools of the camera and chroma key compositing helped me build the technical foundation for my other projects, many of which related to filming and video editing!

### Learning Lab Scenarios Jar

The Learning Lab Scenarios Jar resides on the bookshelf by the tree, and allows us to collect realistic scenarios of things that happen around the Bok Center that we can pull from when workshopping methodologies.

I created a HackMD file to share with other LLUFs in order to explain what the Jar is and encourage them to help contribute to it. I included a GIF that directly applied the technical skills that I learned from the intro-mission-sequence.

While creating the media and guide about the Jar, I considered how to best explain and represent the jar in an engaging manner using the tools at my disposal. This was a perfect example of how chroma key compositing can enhance communication--being able to see both the top and side views of the jar at the same time highlights both writing on the card and placing the card into the jar, all in a condensed GIF.
