# Shorthand Guide with comments

Following Charlie's guide:

1. Start new project
2. Add focus image for title page using the image icon to the right of the section display on the left hand of the screen.

4. Add new section-- I chose to use a "background scrollmation"
* Both Charlie and I couldn't work out how to copy the same image over multiple sections. I also noted how frustrating it was that there is no image editing in shorthand. I had to crop and create new photos manually. 
 
* The scrolling text covers the left side of the page, so if I wanted a consistent scroll (where the text does not change sides), the spotlighted image must always be on the right. The obverse is already on the right (and can be fixed with a little changing of the focus point), but the head sits on the left of the image. I edited this in the mac jpec editor, covering the image I want to hide with a box colour-matching the black background and copy pasting the left hand image. I'm sure there's a faster way to do this that creates a smaller size image, but I couldn't think of anything.
    
    
The original photo goes from this:

 after changing the focus from the centre of the image to the right

For the left hand image I didn't have to refocus the image and just used the new image which looks like this:

and presented like this in the scrollmation

I'm still having a think about how to ensure the pictures line up in a way I'd feel more satisfied in but I'm sure it'd be possible with more precise image editing.


4. I then moved on to using scrollpoints. While Charlie also used this feature, I actually think that for students, scrollmation and scrollpoints are probably the most useful/necessary tools shorthand has to offer.

This tool was pretty intuitive: add a scroll point by using the turqouise button with the pencil on it above the pre existing text. This text also serves as a guide in how to use the feature.

I added a scrollpoint example and then used the "re-order scrollpoints" tool to bring up a sidebar of the left which views each scrollpoint as a slide to rearrange.
