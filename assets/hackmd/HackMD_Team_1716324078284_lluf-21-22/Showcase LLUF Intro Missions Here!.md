Hi! My name is Brenda Ceja. I use they or she pronouns. And I am a Learning Lab Undergraduate Fellow! I am a junior at Harvard College studying Folklore and Mythology, and originally from Los Angeles, California. At the Learning Lab, I am super excited to be working with AVLab, or Audiovisual Lab, and learning how to better use cameras and photography. I am also as always, excited to be assisting with the creative classroom projects happening here at the Lab. 
<br>
<br>
I believe that photography is an essential skill to teach students because it allows for new and underrepresented voices to be heard in the classroom. Traditionally, in my classes I've had to learn mostly through texts and a select number of authors shared on the syllabi. However, photography allows for students to lean into their creativity, and share the daily stories and theory that exists in the world around us. This is why I believe that photography is an invaluable skill to teach students and teachers alike. And now, with the personal cameras in our pockets, photography is even more accessible to students than ever before! This is why it's cruical we teach students proper theory about photography, and allow them to go out into the world and create. This is why I am super excited to be joining AVLab this semester, and as always, happy to be back in the Learning Lab as a LLUF!

Hi everyone! I'm Sharleen, and I'm a Learning Lab Undergraduate Fellow. I'm so excited to be part of Theater Lab this year, and to explore how the mechanisms in games can help make learning more playful! We often find ourselves driving down the same paths--long lectures, and essays, and psets--but I'd like to take this chance to invite everyone to play around a bit and explore new directions in learning!

Hello! My name is Marcus, and I use he/him and they/them pronouns. I'm a Learning Lab Undergraduate Fellow, or a LLUF! I am currently a sophomore in Currier House from Madison, Wisconsin, and I'm studying English and Women, Gender, and Sexuality studies. At the Learning Lab, I am most interested in reality and people's interpretation of reality. Everyone has their own interpretation of what they think the world looks like according to their point of view and the story that they have had in their life so far. And so, to understand all of these different interpretations of reality, I like to participate in avLab, or audio-visual lab, as well as using 3D modelling tools such as Unity and Blender. I think that a major problem in classrooms in the United States and around the world right now is ignorance. There is a lot of ignorance to other people's narratives and other people's realties as we often think of ourselves as the only one with a correct interpretation of reality, when in actuality, each and every one of us has a unique perspective on the world around us. And so, I think that we can use the tools that I learn here at the Learning Lab in order to help people visualize and understand other people's versions of reality. For example, you can create a 3D model of a village or a town or a city, even, inside of a Unity program, and allow people, through a computer screen, to actually walk through a model of a place that they would never be able to travel to in real life. I think giving people the tools to express their own interpretation of reality and making sure that people listen to and understand this perspective in a way that values both the narratives of the person who is telling the story and the person who is listening is the best way that we can combat ignorance in our classrooms and in our education systems. To finish, I would like to read a stanza from one of my favorite poems, Song of Myself, by Walt Whitman. On line 58, Whitman writes, "Welcome is every organ and attribute, of me, and of any man / hearty and clean / Not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and none shall be / less familiar than the rest." If we can give people the tools to find themselves intimately familiar with their peers and fellow classmates, we can work to eliminate ignorance from the classroom and focus on creating an environment of visualization, realization, and understanding. I'm super excited to be doing work this semester with the Learning Lab!
