   It is almost impossible to put into words the amazing value that Sophie added to our work over her many years as a LLUF. In many ways, Sophie embodies everything that the Learning Lab is. She draws on a fantastic intersection of interests and skills, many of which were born out of her experiences as a LLUF.

Sophie was the first of our LLUFs to turn her Senior thesis work into a multimodal format.  [sophie-b thesis website](https://sophiebaud11.github.io/alt-thesis/) The goal of the project was to create "a data storytelling website to showcase my senior thesis and its findings in an accessible way, so that interested readers from different disciplines can understand my research and arguments."
