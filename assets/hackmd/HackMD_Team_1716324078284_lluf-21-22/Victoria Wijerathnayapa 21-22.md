   Victoria came to several tool based course workshops to learn video editing skills for her final project. It was in these, that she became interested in joining the LL team as a LLUF. Despite only having a short time with us so far, she has produced several valuable assets and resources for future fellows and students in courses focusing on video editing techniques. 

## Tools
* Adobe Premiere
* Adobe After Effects
* FCPX
* Buttons

This was actually, maybe, possibly the moment Victoria realized she couldn't continue on without becoming a LLUF. She attended a workshop at the Learning Lab on greenscreen and adobe premiere for

### video edit skill building: content aware fill

> "learned how to remove unwanted objects from footage using content-aware fill. It was definitely frustrating at first because  the mask came out pretty obvious, but after four attempts I'm proud of this one. One trick that helped me was feathering the mask a bit before generating the fill layer which drastically improved how the mask blended after only one layer (which is good because it takes a long time to generate one). This tutorial really helped me https://youtu.be/QBq6ZJBHABU?t=71 although it's slightly outdated (you can ask AE to automatically track the mask for you which saves a lot of time)."

### Staff Button Workshop Support

Victoria learned the studio process for creating buttons from live stills and helped make the workflow a success.

### 5 Essentials Video

Victoria worked on editing a video of Ammara explaining her 5 essential LLUF tools. This video will ultimately be part of the LLUF orientation package. They also created this tutorial for future fellows: [project-edit-LLUF-5-essential-Tools](/nW-0CBC5RmGO_NiTWlZLIg)

> "finally finished the rough cut of LLUF grad essentials (ft. [Ammara-V](/ALw2Hu9JRrO28ovbqDZKkw) She taught me some cool Premiere tricks and introduced me to Photoshop! Attached is a clip of the 4th essential (Camera) and our edited still. I learned about color correction to make bright lights less distracting and masking the camera lens to make it more reflective. I definitely want to work more with Premiere and Photoshop in the future, but I'm also interested in seeing how the workflow process is in Final Cut Pro. For my first time working in Premiere though, this is super exciting!"
