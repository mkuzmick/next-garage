LPCE 101, an introductory course on entrepreneurship, joined the Learning Lab for a video workshop on Wednesday, 11/3 in support of their final projects. Students had joined the Learning Lab previously, learning how to create visual assets for their final video pitches. 

In this workshop, Jordan discussed three principles of videography: camera angle, lighting, and shot length. Leveraging the multi-camera and display set-up in the studio, she encouraged students to remark on how these choices, alone or in concert, can change the mood or message of a shot.

The students split up into their final project groups and prototyped shots for their final videos. On their phones, they tinkered with filming establishing shots and close-ups, keeping in mind angle and lighting choices.

After a half hour, students reconvened and Jordan shared some exemplar shots with the class. She wrapped up the session with a quick crash-course on creating video projects in Canva and a reminder that students can sign up to use the small studio to film their projects.
