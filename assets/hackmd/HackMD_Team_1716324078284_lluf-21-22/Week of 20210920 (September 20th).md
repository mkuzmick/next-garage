# Week of 20210920 (September 20th)

@llufs **It's the week of 20210920 (September 20th)!**<br>
To recap on last week's update, we determined that folks were cool with the idea of putting in a recurring weekly schedule and trying their best to stick to it (with the flexibility of changing your shift as long as you give Jordan 24 hours notice). And a few of you have already done this so a HUGE thank you for that!! It really is going to help us figure out the very best times to have our lab meetings!  :star2::rocket:

If you haven't gotten a chance to put your hours in, here's a link to the [LLUF Schedule calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=aGFydmFyZC5lZHVfbWY0MWk2YWxyMHU2NW9pNjhwbzJzdGJkbmNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ). If for some reason you don't see it/can't access it please let @katie or me know!

## Schedule for the Week
And now we're off to the week's menu of lab happenings! These are also on the calendar.

*(There may be some more labs popping up soon, so keep an eye on the calendar.)*

***Finally, once you've talked with Jordan and have a sense of what you are excited about working on (what labs, tools, etc interest you most this Fall), would you mind sharing a little post here in #ll-virtual-studio?***
