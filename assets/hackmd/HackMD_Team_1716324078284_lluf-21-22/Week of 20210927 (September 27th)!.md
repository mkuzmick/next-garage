# Week of 20210927 (September 27th)!

@llufs **It's the week of 20210927 (September 27th)!**<br>
Last week we did some great workshopping and refining for the [intro mission sequence](https://hackmd.io/ZSRcI0I-RcK0KGhOyxjhoQ)! Big thanks to all who tinkered, improvised, and help come up with so many good ideas. Now it's time for each of us to dig in and complete our final versions! So unless you are joining a lab meeting during your shift, be sure to prioritize this mission. We are hoping to get everyone to finish this by the end of this week if possible. If you have any questions, please reach out to Jordan. <br>
Also last week you were all invited to a new [HackMD team "LLUFs!"](https://hackmd.io/team/llufs?nav=overview) Think of this as a drafting space for ideas, etc. that we can share and collaborate on with our LL community. Eventually, some of these drafts might make it to a more public placeSo far [@Brenda Ceja](https://hackmd.io/3KD7vxygQgCWcqOODzWzoA#Brenda-Ceja) added a [Create a Gif](https://hackmd.io/viIVxO5WRb6nR6pANE5BxQ) study guide and @Abby McElroy added a [Design Brief for our textile project](https://hackmd.io/AUK9DRhbTkGCZcQb75RD-A) of leveling up our classroom sound panels.<br>
