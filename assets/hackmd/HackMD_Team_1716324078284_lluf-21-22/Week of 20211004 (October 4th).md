# Week of 20211004 (October 4th)

@llufs **It's the week of 20211004 (October 4th)!**<br>
Last week a bunch of folks refined and recorded their final version of [intro mission sequence](https://hackmd.io/ZSRcI0I-RcK0KGhOyxjhoQ)! If you haven't completed yours yet, be sure to make that a priority for your asynchronous work time this week! Make sure to upload it to vimeo *(log-in with Google using fellows@learninglab.xyz)*. If you have any questions, please reach out to Jordan.<br>

For folks who have completed the intro mission sequence, the next big asynchronous work will involve the idea of "studies" within your labs.

### #avLab
One such study is around the camera that avLab made last week.
So **if you are docked with avLab, your main mission is to get all the media assets together and posted to slack** *(think of #ll-virtual-studio as the place to "live stream" what's happening, #ll-show-your-work to post the really cool stuff, and VERY IMPORTANTLY--- #ll-photos is where ALL of your media assets should be shared.)* <br>
Here's a list of assets we are looking for: 
1. the portrait (both the upside-down, unprocessed version AND and edited version, 
2. BTS taken with your phone that captures the activity of using the camera (including WIDE SHOT, MEDIUM SHOT, 
3. and least 5 XCU DETAILS of object/action)<br>

### #storyLab
**If you are docked with storyLab, your main mission is to "tell the story" of this study in a bunch of ways.** We listed a ton a couple weeks ago in our storyLab meeting, but to name a few ideas to try: 
- 2 gifs + a paragraph of rationale text, 
- 2 videos + text/voice over, 
- 3 stills + story...
- **and then put into a canva smooth scroll website OR HackMD OR a poster.**

### #theatreLab
**If you are docked with theatreLab, then your main mission is to return to the activity itself, revisit-refine-reimagine how to make it even better!**
