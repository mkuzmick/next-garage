6. zoom in and line up each symbol to a guide. it should snap to the grid, but you will know for sure when you see the blue path (the guide) and green line (the symbol) merge.

    a. to make this easier, go into preferences --> smart guides, and change the snapping tolerance to 10 points.

7. once all card symbols are snapped to their guide, select all of the cards and press "break link". this will allow each card to be edited indiviudally if you want each card to be slightly different. ungroup the content of the card to edit each text box.
