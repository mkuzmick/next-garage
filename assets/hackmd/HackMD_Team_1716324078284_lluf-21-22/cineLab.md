This is a project that has worked to make foreign language films accessible for people with visual impariments. Practically speaking, this involves recording the English translation into a voiceover in Adobe Premiere or Final Cut Pro. It required Charlie to pay attention to the progression of dialogue, tone of voice, and perspective on screen. Using the audio effects in Premiere, some audio was panned left or right or set into the background to match what was appearing on screen. Charlie and Wesley dubbed Jean Vigo's L'Atalante and Agnès Varda's Cléo de 5 à 7, and Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura during the Spring semester.

> "This is a videoessay that I made for the sculpting-time-lab. I analyze shot compositions, sound, and lightning in a scene from the first season of *How To Get Away with Murder*. I used Adobe Premiere and the voice recording app on my iPhone. Within Primiere I specfically took advantage of manipulating video duration, the Ken Burns effect, and audio transitions. From working on this, I learned the importance of being intenrional with planning audio and visual components of videoessays at the outset. I recorded my audio analysis before ever putting the visual pieces together, which made the editing process harder as I tried to make everything feel cohesive. In the future, I would love to implement more technical moves in the videoessay that include sound editing as well as adding border and graphical elements to signpost different aspects of my argument.
