## why essentialsLab?
In essentialsLab, we will develop our skills, our knowledge base, and our capacities in the wide array of tools that abound at the LL. Each week, we will pull together relevant research, evaluate new technologies, and locate best practices and models. Thinking together about whatâ€™s already out there, both within the classroom but also beyond, leads to innovative yet grounded prototypes for testing.

It doesn't matter if you've spent 10 seconds or 10 thousand hours working in one of these essential tools--the time we spend in essentialsLab will serve to hone our abilities to learn, and teach in each of these tools.

For LLUFs who are newer to our LL team, this is a great opportunity to get a taste of some tools you may have never heard of before--and a chance to find something that you are super excited to dig deeper into!

For LLUFs who are more familiar with these tools, this is certainly a time to sharpen those skills and delve into the role of peer tutor before "going live" with students in a course we are supporting.
