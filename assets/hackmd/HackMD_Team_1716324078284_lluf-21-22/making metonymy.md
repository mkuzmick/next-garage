# making metonymy

Something we do often is making graphics from preexisting images to visually illustrate an idea that often isn't physical. 

## the challenge
Using the pen tool, make a graphic representation of an example of metonymy by replacing one concept, with another.

This image below makes a graphic depiction of a car as a metonymy. It's a little boring though!, try something in a sentence, like "I'm on the phone with the White House" or "It's a pigsty in this room!"

how could this be used for data visualisation? 

the image below does a great job of visualising pasta production in different countries.

make a data visualisation of statistics (you can make it up, or use actual data!)

## making onomatopoeia

How could you visualise onomatopoeia? Using the text tool, how could you create a visual dimension that encapsulates the aural aspect of the device?

Think about how the words move through your mouth, and try to represent these intonations.

How is the representation contextual? How might the "ZAP" of a laser in a sci-fi context differ visually from the "ZAP" of a taser in a drama/action context?
