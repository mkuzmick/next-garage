# microproject-SOCIOL1130-class-photos

this past week, we had a Sociology course come by. During their visit, we had a number of them smile for the green screen -- the challenge here is to simply process a few different style options to send back to them!

you'll need to load each of these images into Photoshop to remove the background -- while you're at it, it's also a good opportunity to put in a nicely styled, color background. 

### the challenge

the goal here will be to take each of these images and run it through Photoshop -- first to remove the background, and second to apply a new one and style it. [you can find the photos here!](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rddWORySsJ56tTQItz-wGz1SG4hiAVjb?usp=sharing)

the workflow will look something like this: 
1. import your image and remove the background(instructions at the bottom of this page!)
2. export that image, with a completely transparent background -- this is so that we can choose to print it on any colored paper we'd like
3. choose a color and replace the background with it! 
4. export this image as well(also, a .png)
5. apply a black and white filter(and maybe increase the contrast?) so that the subject is black and white, on a colorful background -- this color doesn't have to be the same one as the previous!

once you're done, [you can upload the images here!](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KY6QbFpSh_1SaXDPIqdvQ5U8ZVXoYJdo?usp=sharing)
