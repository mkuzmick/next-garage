# microproject-world-map-museums

help us make one of the Harvard Horizons visual assets! We'd like to get two versions of this done ASAP. Let Jordan know if you are taking on one of these please! and also, giant thank you!!

## Version 1
use the map provided by jordan as a base layer for a Photoshop or Illustrator map. Place markers (as simple dots with hex code=F3F3F3) where the museums listed [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iRzou3kN60PYskDpQIk0Nrc9KPUy_cwm/edit) are located. 

## Version 2
skills required: blender

make a 3D version-aka a globe instead of a 2D map!
