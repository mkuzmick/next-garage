# project-edit-LLUF-5-essential-Tools


### Getting Started
Welcome to Premiere Pro! It is one of the most used video editing tools by professionals and amateurs alike. It can be a bit confusing at first, but in no time you'll be able to edit videos like a real Pro!

To begin, open the Premiere Pro app. To start a new project, simply click New Project on the right. Or, click on one of the recent projects to open an existing project. If you want to open an existing project but it doesn't appear under Recent, simply click Open Project on the right and select the appropriate file from Finder.

If you're starting a new project, you'll be promted to select the files you want to work with. Don't worry, you can import more later. Select the file(s) that you want to work with from the menu. Multiple types of media—like video, audio, or image—can be selected.
##### _Pro Tip_: If you have a lot of different media files, you can place them in a single folder and then select just the folder when making a new project.
Once you've made your selections, click Create. After your media finished importing, you will see the Premiere workspace window. This is where you will be doing the majority of your work with Premiere. Let's take a quick look at each section of the workspace. ![](https://i.imgur.com/AyN2iA6.jpg)







### Basic Shortcuts
Keyboard shortcuts make working on Premiere Pro faster. Many basic universal shortcuts (like Comm. + C for Copy or Shift for Selecting) work in Premiere, but there are some Premiere-only shortcuts that are helpful to learn!

* V -> Selection Tool - This is your first tool. It lets you drag and move clips around, select settings, etc. It's basically just a regular computer arrow!
* H -> Hand Tool - This tool let's you move around through the timeline without making selections or accidentally moving a clip or clicking something you don't want.
* C -> Razor Tool - This tool lets you cut a clip at a specific point
* Comm. + A -> Select All - This shortcut automatically selects all clips on the timeline.
* J -> Play in Reverse - The preview plays in reverse. Press J twice to play in reverse faster.
* K -> Pause - Pauses the preview.
* L -> Play Forward - Plays the preview normally. Press L twice to play faster.



### Synchronizing Multiple Videos
If you're working on editing a video and have mutltiple camera angles, synchronizing the clips can help make editing easier!
