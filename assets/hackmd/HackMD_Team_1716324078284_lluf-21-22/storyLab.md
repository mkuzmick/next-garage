I had the opportunity to cover a workshop for LPCE 101, a course on entrepreneurship. Students were devising brief 'pitch' videos advertising their start-up ideas to investors. Jordan and Marlon helped them think about cinematographic moves they could make to appeal to their audience and tell a compelling story about their product. I served as the strenographer for the event, eventually synthesizing what went down into a story for the AirTable! I jotted notes down in HackMD, which I consolidated in StoryLab that following Friday. I scanned footage I got from Casey to find and save stills that encapsulated the event. I became more comfortable with working in Final Cut Pro, in particular, as well as navigating the AirTable story database. I really had a blast coming to the LPCE event, and I look forward to covering more stories next semester!

This is a write-up I did for Dr. Gold's EXPOS 20 class. Students came to the Learning Lab with exhibits for the final research paper in mind and brainstormed the types of background information, analysis, and theoretical tools they plan on using to bring their papers to life. In my report, I specfically discuss how color-coded note cards spatially allowed students to engage with their topics more deeply as well as recognize connections between their sources. I am excited to continue exploring alternative methods of teaching and engaging with various learning schemas.
