# visual essay sample student work

**Image-Geo-Text**
My project looked to explore the settings found in literary works in textual and visual modes. I chose to work with Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None, set on Burgh Island in South Devon, UK. Using photoshop, in one example I combined old maps of the island with current satellite imagery, extracts from the text which detailed the journey through the landscape.  In another, I merged historic photographs of the hotel with recent photos, integrating the appearance of how the hotel looked when Christie was writing with how it appears today. Within photoshop, this project involved manipulating the scale, perspective and alignment of these images.

Sophie was the first of our LLUFs to turn her Senior thesis work into a multimodal format.  [sophie-b thesis website](https://sophiebaud11.github.io/alt-thesis/) The goal of the project was to create "a data storytelling website to showcase my senior thesis and its findings in an accessible way, so that interested readers from different disciplines can understand my research and arguments."

> "I made a magazine-style layout for the proposal for my hypothetical capstone project. I altered a furniture advertisment to allow for sufficient writing space alongside images, exploring how urban spaces in harvard square are inaccessible to homeless populations and how the autocentric nature of harvard's campus serves tourists more than students. I had never used adobe indesign before, so this activity really helped me understand how indesign could be used as tool with built in explaining as opposed to only the graphics of illustrator.

> My magazine spread is about what harvard square would look like were it redesigned for its inhabitants. how would the roads and crossings change? how would green space be reimagined? i tried my best to create a layout that was clear and simple in boxes, but that allowed lots of space for images, because ultimately they will be the centre of my project! i colour matched the background of textboxes to the image they are on top of to blend them in while the text is still readable, and used consistent sizing and boxes on my grid to ensure the spacing felt right."


3D models for Money Matters
"The learning lab did a workshop in my class and I decided that for my final project I was going to use the skills I had learned at the learning lab this semester and design and create a 3D coin on illustrator and blender. This project took a lot of troubleshooting but ultimately I came out with a project I was really proud of. Before January I had never even heard of illustrator or blender and so upon reflection it seems amazing how much more comfortable I've become with both of these. I found myself experimenting with blender, in particular, the second time around and look at my final version with pride that I was able to work so much of it out from knowledge and intuition without having to look it up!"
