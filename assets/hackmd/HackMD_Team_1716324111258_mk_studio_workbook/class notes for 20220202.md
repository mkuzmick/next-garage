# class notes for 20220202

Another weekly doc. Casey and I will type in here as we go, but you are ALL welcome to contribute. This is both a record of what we learn on a given night AND the site for us to "co-construct" that learning (if you can handle the jargon!), so please do feel free to jump in!

## the plan

1. taking a look at the form and discussing where we go next
2. discussion of the mayer article and its application
3. look at samples
4. shooting
    * cameras
    * lights
    * audio
    * performance
5. homework for next time = shooting exercise

## the form

Let's check out the results and discuss next steps.
* plans for the editing tutorial sessions
* plans for the advanced tutorial sessions


## mayer, slack and more
* let's keep the mayer discussion going in the [#scholarship-of-teaching-and-learning](https://educationalvi-0e41145.slack.com/archives/C030S64GRFB) channel. 
* and let's join other channels too!
    * let's discuss higher ed news and trends in [#higher-ed](https://educationalvi-0e41145.slack.com/archives/C03135Y1F32) 
    * let's geek out in the [#gear](https://educationalvi-0e41145.slack.com/archives/C030S64GRFB) channel if that's our thing
    * let's constantly share what we've made in [#show-your-work](https://educationalvi-0e41145.slack.com/archives/C030R3HHRLH)
* also don't forget that the hackmd is *collaborative*--meaning that you can add docs yourself if you want (we may nudge you towards this as the term goes on!)



## your samples

* let's discuss with Mayer in mind
* later, as we discuss cameras, lights and microphones, we'll keep returning to these as references


## cameras

    * long shots/full shots
    * [medium shots](https://www.premiumbeat.com/blog/how-to-frame-a-medium-shot-like-a-master-cinematographer/)

## random

random MK experiment that's pretty low key

after doing this, I realized that I was subconsciously creating a mashup of two of my favorite film actors:
