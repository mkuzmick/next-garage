# metaproject-the-ll-machine

* think carefully about what goes into these daily working docs, and how they are organized and created. 
    * Ultimately the list really needs to be in Airtable, 
    * and today we pick some focal points, select them, and create a doc
    * work happens in that doc
    * then work gets delivered to slack and reintegrated into the Airtable
    * leftovers handled, but completion incentivized
* a great deal happens in ll-studio-bot, but not all


### ecosystem of elements

* slack apps
    * ll-studio-bot
    * ll-image-bot
    * ll-task-bot
* slack channels
* airtable bases
* views
    * web
    * paper
* prompts and tasks
    * especially LLUF and staff-facing
* the studio
    * things
        * 3D concepts for keying person at table into a 3D environment that, in turn, incorporates elements of the table
        * having one person as stagehand for the other is a great mechanic
        * and will have ways to play in AR for sure
        *
