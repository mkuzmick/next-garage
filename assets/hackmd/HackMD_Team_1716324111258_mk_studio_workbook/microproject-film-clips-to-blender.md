# microproject-film-clips-to-blender

let's log the steps here for this workflow, and maybe insert a few relevant tutorials along the way.

## steps

* rip the footage
* bring into fcpx and determine frames to grab
    * this needs to be done manually, I'd argue
    * and maybe having a faster way to create the stills would be better?
    * also, we want a movie with one frame per shot
    * then we'll render these out of blender as single frames and reassemble in fcpx or elsewhere to get the timing right?
    * can be done all in blender if we really need something happening at 24 or 30fps (i.e. a camera move)
* or into Resolve and do the same
