# microproject-ll-blender-startup-file

this may actually be a full-on project if we combine it with some learning elements, like the basics of academic blender-ing.

* what about a game-board-like config, where you navigate around the space, try to match a shot or two, learn keyboard shortcuts and navigation, etc?
* can be a couple of collections to (like a level 1 and level 2?)
    * this might get too heavy. we do want people to be able to hit `A`, `X`, `return` to start fresh
* at least a welcome to the Learning Lab billboard held up by truss, nicely lit and framed with the camera? (rendering Eevee in less than 5 seconds)
