    * most recent shots by that user?
    * most recent markdown for that user?
    * invitation to tag by thumbnail?
    * register user?
    * have space for them to augment app, set config, create custom functions and reaction-based events


* for the personal workspace, people want
    * a clean slate area that they start from scratch each day
    * but also easy access to all of their work in progress
    * and somewhat easy access to reference material, old projects, shared assets, etc.
    * could the slack app home play a role?
*  so what if the slack app home becomes the homebase? and incentivizes contributions to the system?
*  if this happened on the studio slack, that could be cool. can we send md there? or should there be buttons there that request things elsewhere?
