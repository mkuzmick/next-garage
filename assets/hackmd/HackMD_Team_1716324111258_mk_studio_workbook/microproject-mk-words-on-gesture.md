# microproject-mk-words-on-gesture

There's evidence that audiences find gesture both captivating and meaningful, but when we try to articulate why gesture should matter for academic communication (conference talks, lectures, classroom discussions), it's actually a little bit hard to do.

A movement of the arms, a tilt of the head a flourish with the hands--what do they *say?* Do they *say* anything at all?

As teachers and learners and researchers, we are focus on data, facts, theoretical models, interpretations, arguments. Typically on words and graphs and tables that have *meanings*. And these gestures don't seem, on the face of it, to mean *anything*.

We could attempt to argue that they are at least aesthetically pleasing--that they "keep us interested" and hence are valuable, in the classroom, say, to maintain student engagement, ensuring that they keep paying attention long enough to get the message.

But we can actually take an even stronger position than this. One that will actually allow us to expand the range and importance of gesture's deployment in academic communication.
