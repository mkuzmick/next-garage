### Saturday

some things to build for the new year.
* **cards.** Ability to get things from physical to digital and back again. Ability to get things out of Airtable and onto the boards (kanbans, say). But also the ability to capture everything from a workshop and dynamically render (and interact with) for follow-up activities. Virtual and other galleries, etc. Capture with [music](https://hackmd.io/iysHvT8YSYmxKfNcUIgzUA) and other novel mechanics.
* **slack bots**. From Slack to Airtable and back again. Hold on to updates, creat external links, add links to Airtable, handle tags and add to Airtable. Live logging, live image production, etc.
* **airtable**. Bases for resources, tasks, images, stories, workflow elements.
* **3d**. Blender and C4D.
* **ar**. Unity and ARKit.
* **studio scripts**. ingest. studio-bot. peakGifs, randomStills, io2gif, m2s.

So. A key question => which of these have multiplier effects? Clearly all of the airtable-related elements, and those that get back and forth between airtable and slack.

* slack
    * create-resource
    * create-link
    * create-external-link
    * create-gif
    * create-task
    * show-your-work
* airtable
    * ResourceBase
    * TaskBase
    * links between all hackmd docs and records
    * workflow for copying hackmd over and deleting

On tasks:
* should the "inbox" really just be in `Tasks` (a view there?)
* individualized inboxes created by virtue of who the user is?
* users list

    
#### ll-studio-bot

work to get it started. The link to [project-ll-studio-bot](/-ACxwUVYQcKOh3NG-195dA). We'll put notes there.

some elements for fun:

simple concept for adding markdown to airtable:

```
let table = base.getTable("PublicImages");
let view = table.getView("CreateMarkdown");
let queryResult = await view.selectRecordsAsync({fields: ["Name", "ImageFiles"]});

for (let record of queryResult.records) {
    await table.updateRecordAsync(record.id, {
                "Markdown": `![alt text](${record.getCellValue("ImageFiles")[0].url})`
            }    
    )
}


```
