# mk-mechanic-blown-out-whiteboard

We usually shoot cards and paper and artworks and objects on the tables, because the tables are so central to our brand.

But the whiteboards are there, so we should use them I suppose.

One little idea = get people to create little clusters on the board that serve as visual narratives (of projects, events, ideas, etc), then blow out the background so it looks like the content is floating on the hackmd page.

Here's a visual report on Jessi's designLab activity, for instance.

And here is a little line of Eno-over-time images I printed out to bridge the gap on the board between the essentialsLab zone and the Eno essay itself. If you are interested in adding your own "me-over-time" series, there is room above and below that needs to be filled!

And here is that essentialsLab cluster, while we're at it. It too is the table, actually--just with an invert layer applied in photoshop. But the texture is all totally the table: the grain of the wood, the cuts made by generations of students.

Anyway. It's a mechanic.

After laying out the Eno essay in a strip, I did think that it would be cool to run some Expos activities on the big boards, so I think we can deploy some of these moves in that context for sure.
