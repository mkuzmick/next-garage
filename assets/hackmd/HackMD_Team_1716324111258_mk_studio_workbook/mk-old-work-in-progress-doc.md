## NOTES

* the goal is not to make the work easy. it's to make things possible. black boxes and automations make things easier, but each and every one robs people of learning experiences, occasions to develop tacit knowledge and awareness of both the meaning and the interconnectness of things. so think carefully before you hide complexity from them.
* nice example => the difference between dragging a card in the kanban view of Airtable and filling in a cell in grid view. all the difference in the world.
    * also configurability. like which of the things plugged in to this power strip do i want to use at this moment?
