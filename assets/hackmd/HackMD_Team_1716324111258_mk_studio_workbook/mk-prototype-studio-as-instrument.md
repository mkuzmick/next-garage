# mk-prototype-studio-as-instrument

In [essentialsLab this week](https://hackmd.io/LG7Y0yhkRVqHF_HPQjtEVQ) the task is to read a Brian Eno lecture on "The Studio as Compositional Tool," then to reflect a bit on the ways in which the Learning Lab Studio itself could be a sort of compositional tool.

So. Since JK is out of town, I'm going to try to help her out by doing two things at once:
1. doing her usual "board of the week" while she's away, and, 
2. making the board itself a reflection on the LL-Studio-as-instrument if I can.

## elements of the week

let's list the elements and fragments and try to find some narrative threads?

## the RAUC Rock

Kids are useful research tools. And for those that do the Christmas thing, presents make for great [cultural probes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_probe).  This year we got Conrad a button maker, and within 2 weeks he had started a campaign for his school, Rindge Avenue Upper Campus, centered on images of The Rock (it's a Rock-RAUC pun thing). He had powered through his 100 button starter pack within a week--first making one for each of his friends, then for frenemies, then random kids. Ultimately even all the teachers populated their whiteboards boards with magnetic versions of the pins.

</center>

As soon as magnets on whiteboards come in to play, there's clearly an LL connection.

## LL People

My initial thought with the whole button thing was to return to a project left dormant by covid-era mask-restrictions. In 2019 and 2020, Dani had been running off a series of black-and-white-on-color portraits of LLUFs and other LL People. Ultimately there are so many people that we don't have room for an 8x8 of every person (hence, buttons).

This is *also* a solution to a design challenge we've had for a while around smaller-sized images. We've had a goal of aggregating large quantities of images of workshops and student projects, etc, but small printed square photos have never managed to capture the energy of the events they supposedly represent. Moreover, while it is theoretically possible to produce a nice layout of them if you adhere to strict margin guidelines, in practice, this is hard to do. Clusters of buttons are easier to lay out in intentional-seeming patterns.

So buttons become ways of preserving key moments of time, and their aggregation produces a nice quantitative metric for program evaluation.

## Buttons for Courses

Part of the justification for the machine had to be use for students in actual courses, and there are at least four levels at which this tool (like many of our tools) can be deployed.

### 1: AFVS 70

The first level deployment involves LL staff using the tool to create stuff for undergrads in courses. Here the goal is mainly engagement and enthusiasm, and the complexities of the production process are kept off-stage.

In AFVS 70, Jordan put together buttons that served as a "badge" of sorts, indicating that you had learned montage-editing in Premiere with the LL.


### 2: Expos 20 

Second-level deployment of a tool involves using it to craft, sculpt, preserve or display student work. With our video cameras, for instance, we record student presentations

In the best case scenarios, the student's generate their work in dialogue with the constraints and affordances of the tool. For instance, Expos 20: the Oral Tradition, has worked with us for a while now on activities related to essay structure. At times students display their structures under overhead cameras (having generated visual structures that make the best use of these cameras' affordances); at times they create short oral riffs for live improvisation over Logic Loops we launch for them. The choices of tool, medium and form cannot be random, as the goal is for the student to experience some deeper understanding of the content and skills they're developing in the class (so Logic Loops are chosen to reinforce the tension-to-resolution pattern at work in academic writing, for instance).

So where do buttons come in? Well, one of the challenges of teaching structure to students in a writing class is that it has a tendency to become fixed and static too early in the process. And some of the standard things we focus on in writing courses actually tend to reinforce this.

Focus on transitions and signposts is great, but it arrives a little too late, because you are essentially trying to cope with a structure that already exists (and the writer may resist the drastic revisions required to substantially shift this structure). 

Outlining, on the other hand, arrives too early. To be sure, it promises to allow the writer to craft the ideal structure before committing to the writing itself. But in practice it locks the writer into the structure they plot out when they are LEAST aware of what they're actually saying in the paper (because much of this is actually developed *through* the writing process).

While our index cards (and their relative dynamism, when compared to the sticky notes that are typically used for brainstorming-like activities) allow for much greater flexibility and movement than a typical outline. You could argue that during the first 7-10 minutes of a 45-minute activity in the learning lab we want even LESS structure than these cards offer. For while a pile of messy cards on the table certainly looks unstructured, from a graphic design perspective you could argue that the cards "want" to form a grid . . . simply making them look nice nudges you in that direction. And while ultimately this level of conceptual clarity is crucial for the writer, at the first moment they might be helped by a network of nodes or clusters that they can wander through in search of a structure first.

So during the Oral Tradition workshops this week we tried that. Instead of beginning with square cards, we precut card stock into button-sized circles, and it was these circular cards that students used to think through the compare and contrast essays they were creating . . . 

So, to sum up, in this second level deployment, we've moved from the button as "decoration" or "prize" or "memento" to engage and motivate students to the button (and its circular shape) as equipment for structuring ideas: both for learning those ideas and presenting them. 

We still created button-prizes for the students who volunteered to present, but this was a level-one deployment tacked on to the core activity. Here too, however, the actual use of the tool remains "off stage"--the making happens invisibly, and the students enjoy the products. 

### 3: HistSci 1890

Third level deployment involves the students in the process of production. Not so that they can become experts with the tool, but because there's something about a very basic or amateur-level "taste" of the tool that works well as a learning experience. 

In HistSci 1890, students were learning about the difference between agile and waterfall methods of software development, as well as some of the similarities between agile software development and other revolutionary modes of collective creation.

So we split the class into groups . . .
* manifestos and buttons as fragments and maxims
* links to riot grrrl and bikini kill

## EssentialsLab

* studio as instrument
    * into eno?
* branding for course


## Music207

no buttons, but 4th-level use of cameras and microphones. 

* interrotron in the age of covid
* tool for human connection becomes tool for celebration of the human

## studio as instrument

* essay w buttons on top
* printed to length of board = 6 x 17" with 1 inch margins + maybe a couple of inches

## Eno over time

Just needed to create a connection between the essentialsLab zone and the Eno essay, so created a little timeline of portraits leading from [the Roxy Music days](https://www.vulture.com/2019/03/roxy-music-guide-bryan-ferry-brian-eno.html) till now.
