## thinking & writing

so. over the break at least there are these three zones:

* blender
* slack-bot & airtable (backend-ish)
* gatsby & time-lines & slack app home (front-end)

anything not captured there?

* comic book spreads (though we are still doing these for blender)
    * maybe do a simple one with snowmen and truss pieces on how to build truss
    * could do this with a slack interface
        * type in the numbers of each type of piece
        * enter character type and number
        * get back a blend file
        * update once a still has rendered to have that as a thumbnail (array of pieces ready to build with)
* expos multimodal essay stuff
    * need descriptions of some basic activities
    * need prototypes of some of the spring assignments (with prompts and rationales)
* description of the project-and-prototype-centric workflow
    * projects for courses (MDFs and Staff)
        * prompts
        * workshops
        * tutorials
    * prototypes (LLUFs and Staff)
        * sample student work
    * essentially turns us into a secret multimodal essay course, with TFs and students, etc
    * but the defense is slightly different than the design-thinking-ish defense of years past. The idea is that you are launching these students (and TFs, and prof--the whole community) into a collective making project, so you don't want to do this without an initial prototype
    * deliver to course
        * list of loads of ideas
        * (at least) one idea done, with markup
* ll basics
    * 



steps

* the ll show base. a base to integrate with the studio hackmd (or even replace it ultimately)
    * pieces of work
    * resources
    * shows (of work)
    * prototypes
    * logs of work
    * timelines of work
    * projects
    * metaprojects
    * microprojects
    * tags of tools, media, forms, etc
* the base needs to exist by Jan 1
    * at least logs of work
* printing is crucial by Jan 15
* 
* a couple of proof of concept round-trips
    * snowmen building the ll-stage truss in comic book
    * ll slack bot build out?


it takes time to build things. And if you wait until the technology is ready before you start building, you're too late. You build for where the puck is going to be, as they say.

So.

Right now.

The key is to build for a future where more of reality is manipulable. Malleable. Designable. Given this given, what sorts of experiences and environments do you want to construct?

Us? We want to teach, and also to preserve. 

Let's be clear: we will lean into the future as hard as (or harder than) Moretti did. We'll tend toward the new for its own sake, toward the avant-garde, toward the desire to burn the detritus of the past. At least as our default.

But we will wed this with a deeply conservative (Bloom-ish and Heidegger-ish) desire to do justice to the past. As if our lives depended on it (which they do).

So.

You will have your cake and eat it too.

what goes in the different slack apps?
* the-studio-bot
    * m2s, gif, io2s, switching, ATEM, etc.
* the-show-your-work-bot or ll-story-bot
    * mainly working docs
    * reporting docs
    * images of work
* things for now
    * microprojects
    * linked to projects
    * place to post all images
