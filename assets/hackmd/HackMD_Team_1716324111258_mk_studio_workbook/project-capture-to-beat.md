# project-capture-to-beat

possible ways of syncing:
* play directly from a machine that knows the timecode . . . needs to be accurate to the half-second or so, ideally
* just capture with music, manually start on beat or count-in
* programmatically identify beat (or logic metronome or count-in)


there probably is a case to be made for crafting the songs ourselves.
