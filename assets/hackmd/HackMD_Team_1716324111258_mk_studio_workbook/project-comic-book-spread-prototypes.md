# project-comic-book-spread-prototypes

## PROJECT BASICS

### SUMMARY

Building on their discussion of Scott McCloud's *Understanding Comics*, the members of the [Illustrating Ideas Cluster](/kX9p_XSFSV-kcRSlc-dAag) (among others) will be spending December and January developing prototypes of comic books, graphic novels, manga, comic strips, storyboards, and related forms. The goal will be to produce as many **two page spreads** as possible, and for each of these spreads to be an example of something we can imagine doing more of in the future (either something that we can imagine many students doing as an assignment/activity or something we can imagine integrating into our media and story-production workflow in the coming year). In addition, we will produce tutorials on creating the spreads using the wide variety of tools you can use for this purpose.

### RATIONALE 
While we do not yet have any requests for us to support comic/graphic-novel/manga production, there are compelling reasons for us to pursue this project:
* the skills involved in producing these comic book spreads are valuable across a wide array of LL projects, so it's an opportunity for internal skill-building
* the form is becoming increasingly popular in the undergraduate curriculum, and we should prepare to support faculty who are assigning graphic novels in their courses (*insert examples*)
* (*related to Graphical Abstracts Project--**flesh this out***)
* (*the form itself seems right for certain bits of visual data--architecture, for instance--**flesh this out***)
* (*even in courses not interested in final visual projects, this could be a valuable scaffolding step--**flesh this out***)
* (*will drive our development of key media production workflows--**flesh this out***)
* (*we want to develop this as a form of reporting/thanking classes/profs--**flesh this out***)
* could be a good form for some of our instructional materials for certain courses
* the form forces condensation, synthesis, selection, and other higher-order processes. So while it does take extra time, it would be a good fit for situations where you want students to spend a fair amount of time on an outcome that could, on the surface of things, look "small," but which could involve important higher-order intellectual operations.

### TIMELINE

Milestones

* **November 22:** Launch
* **November 29:** First method tutorial and sharing work in progress
* **January 7:** Call your shot (if you're doing it for real, tell us what you're doing)

### MVP

At least one example with a tutorial on the process used to achieve it. 

### EXTRA FEATURE REQUESTS

* examples using a wide variety of tools and workflows (and tutorials/walkthroughs for these tools and workflows)
    * Adobe Capture
    * Adobe Illustrator
    * Photoshop
    * FCPX
    * iOS Clips app
    * Blender Manga shader
    * C4D Sketch and Toon

* sample prompts and other materials
    * rubrics for grading
    * student-facing tutorials
    * sample assignment prompts
* connections to related projects
    * woodcuts
    * album covers
    * poster making
    * 


## TOOLS, TECHNIQUES AND MODELS

### VECTORIZING WITH ADOBE CAPTURE AND ILLUSTRATOR

Both Adobe Capture (smartphone app) and Adobe Illustrator allow you to vectorize images (with Capture allowing you to get a live preview of the result and to capture from within the app).

### FCPX COMIC BOOK EFFECT
One workflow we've experimented with in the past involves using the Final Cut Pro comic book effect with footage we capture with our cameras.
