# project-ll-airtable-tools

Over the course of 21-22, we'll work to build more of the tools that help us get data in and out of Airtable.

### GOALS

For people to input information wherever they want (and for us to passively acquired information), but for this all to end up structured and safe in Airtable.

### MVP

We'll settle for at least
* getting at least one feed in from Slack for tasks or events
* getting at least one markdown output for tasks or events


### FEATURE REQUESTS

too numerous to list. But if we don't list them we won't make them.

* have a gist that just assembles an array of records as objects with all fields (surprisingly not in the API)
* assemble tasks into markdown docs
* parse markdown and create records from it (headings to specific values, YAML to tags, images to image URLs or even attachments?)
* markdown list to airtable tasks or inbox
* project report record to markdown and back again (save earlier versions?)


### NOTES

One question concerns which features should live in Airtable scripts and which should live in node scripts or on servers.
