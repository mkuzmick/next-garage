# project-ll-card-workflow


* **cards.** Ability to get things from physical to digital and back again. Ability to get things out of Airtable and onto the boards (kanbans, say). But also the ability to capture everything from a workshop and dynamically render (and interact with) for follow-up activities. Virtual and other galleries, etc. Capture with [music](https://hackmd.io/iysHvT8YSYmxKfNcUIgzUA) and other novel mechanics.
