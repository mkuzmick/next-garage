# project-ll-show-your-work-2022


## goals

### focus and completion

help users focus on one key working doc at a time. In a sense, you are checking the doc out, working on it, then checking it back in. Hopefully less multitasking.

### storytelling

some automatic, some requiring a little human intervention.


### structured capture

of
* text
* images
* videos
* links

## log

### 20211231

* start up a daily working doc?
* then sort according to project?
* or actually force project-specific docs one at a time?

        * get tasks or projects or docs by string (user, tool, etc.)
            * user checks the stuff he/she wants, 
            * if just title or title plus notes
            * then gets daily markdown doc shipped their way
            * * key elements of work machine for Jan
        * keep it in studio slack for now
            * or have it be "show your work" bot or machine
            * titled just "show your work"
            * you can DM it to get it to log things
            * and
