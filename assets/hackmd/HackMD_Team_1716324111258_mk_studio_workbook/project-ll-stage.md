### set design
* [walkthrough of a Melbourne Theatre production's set design process](https://www.mtc.com.au/discover-more/mtc-now/the-set-design-process/)
* [high school tech production site](https://hstech.org/) is full of great how-tos
* think about [backdrops](https://www.showtex.com/en/blog/buyers-guide-fabrics/how-choose-stage-and-event-backdrop) too?
* lots of [sketchup files at this set-design basics site](https://sites.google.com/site/mvdramatech/home/set-construction/basic-constructions)
* [random youtube video on building flats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCJvHbDQV0Q)
* [not exactly the thing, but ok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELTIWzn-VAc)
* [youtube tips on stage platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBIlgzy-7jE) again roughly same as our top element
* [another similar process for low stage platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0legGfk_k0)
* [another backyard stage idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGPCE-GUCcg)---these all have fewer joists than we're thinking
* this [how to build a film set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydIob5yv74U) video has bits on flats and floors
* [building a theatre stage in a day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJxyITXNtg)
* [building stairs](https://hstech.org/how-to-tech/carpentry/stairs-2/)
* [hstech on plywood](https://hstech.org/how-to-tech/platforming-things-to-stand-on-stage-decks-etc/plywood/#)
* nice [stage-construction pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/jejlopez/stage-construction/)

### stage and risers
* [simple home stage riser setup](https://rogueengineer.com/diy-theater-riser-construction/) that's similar in scope to what we hope to do.
* [harlequin floors](https://aus.harlequinfloors.com/en/content/uploads/2018/09/Harlequin_Stage_Technology_Guide_-_Aus-May-2019.pdf) has useful products but will also give you ideas
* [portable stage](https://www.wwbw.com/Control-Acoustics-Portable-Stage-with-Rubber-Diamond-Mat-Surface-H59369-H59369000002000.wwbw?source=TWWR5J1BB&cntry=us&currency=usd&source=TWWRAH4BD&gclid=Cj0KCQiAkZKNBhDiARIsAPsk0Wh3NHhVTHvlVLnXkf4FvL7jdAOZnXWTvwQV6Z9NjVRGP69QrTSlwuwaAiGIEALw_wcB) just for reference. We don't want this, but the construction is something to reference.
* [youtube of modular riser concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff8LiHGpFKQ) that again isn't what we want if we're using Truss for the riser base . . . but the floor itself and its support is useful as a reference

### stage and dance flooring
* [4x4 tapdance floor kit](https://www.greatmats.com/portable-dance-floor/4x4-ft-dance-floor-kit.php)
* [6x6 tapdance floor kit](https://www.greatmats.com/portable-dance-floor/6x6-ft-dance-floor-kit.php)
* [portable marley](https://www.greatmats.com/dance-flooring/rosco-dance-ballet-floors-10lf.php)
* the [portable stage options](https://www.thestagedepot.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=EZLSTAGE) look like total disasters---how do people survive using this stuff? :)
* maybe this [all-terrain portable stage option](https://www.thestagedepot.com/product_p/ATSTAGE12848.htm?gclid=Cj0KCQiAkZKNBhDiARIsAPsk0Wjk9WAU1-kbM1p8_C0vRGwUl9e4PRM5kriC8wED4aGPfmqINOduOegaAtErEALw_wcB) is sturdier than the others from that site?
* for dance-floor options, [this subfloor](https://www.stagestep.com/subfloor-systems/springstep-4/) with [this dance floor](https://www.stagestep.com/dance-floors/timestep-collection/timestep/) (that you can install temporarily with tape) seems like a good option
* [this dance floor](https://www.stagestep.com/dance-floors/foam-backed-flooring/) can also be installed with [tape they also sell](https://www.stagestep.com/installation-products/#tapesandadhesives) and looks like a good all-in-one solution
* discussion of [different plywood options for floors](https://www.actionfloors.com/blog/stage-flooring-maple-pine-masonite/)



## notes

* the stage is maybe taking more time than it should
    * one big Q: should we incorporate that back corner?
    * and is there a place to project large things there?
    * we should have one 48x96 (or larger) projection screen . . . this will fit with some of the other 48x96 elements
