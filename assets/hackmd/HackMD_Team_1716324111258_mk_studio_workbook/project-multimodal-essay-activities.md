# project-multimodal-essay-activities

and beyond?

## PROJECT BASICS

### SUMMARY

We require two (well, at least two) sorts of things: 
1. a pool of resources for students performing multimodal essays in courses
2. an array of activities we perform in the studio

Of course, we have many of these things in stock already, but Dec/Jan will be a good time to aggregate some of these, and, perhaps even more importantly, to develop some templates for the Spring-time production of MORE of these resources. 

### RATIONALE 

We routinely encounter requests from course for resources on the entire array of multimodal assignments: essay films, podcasts, oral presentations, 3d galleries, and more. And while it is impossible to generate the an encyclopedic inventory of these resources, we'd still like to do our best to compile what we *do* have so that it's easier to access and display when needed.

But there is also an internal rationale. Fellows, such as Jessi, who's leading theatreLab this term, are constantly creating resources and ideas, and we want to find a way to continually aggregate these over the years in a way that
1. gives fellows autonomy and creative ownership over what they do, while simultaneously
2. sorts and organizes and compiles so that all of the fellows' work aggregates into a larger collective project.
Aim one pulls us towards greater freedom, while aim two pulls us in the direction of more rules, constraints and templates. We'll do our best to hit a nice compromise between the two--or even better a synthesis of the two that does require any meaningful or harmful sacrifices.


### TIMELINE

Milestones

* **December 6th:** Launch
* **December 17th:** Initial prototypes of
    * a resource doc
    * an activity doc
    * prompts for others desiring to create their own resources and activities
    * the Airtable that aggregates these
    * initial plans of which MDF and LLUF groups might contribute to these resources over time
    * identify resources and activity descriptions we want to create for Expos
* **January 7:** 
    * any resources and activities that we want to use in the ARC events
    * meet with Jessi to discuss connections to theatreLab
    * identify anyone else hoping to make resources
    * contact Expos
* **January 14th:**
    * identify and create the resources and activity
    * meet with Expos
* **January 21:** Wrap/Show-and-Tell 
    * have message ready for Spring Expos preceptors

### MVP

At a bare minimum, we want
* resource docs for **theatreLab**
* resource docs for **visualEssayLab**
* **podcast** resources logged as resource docs
* 5-7 key activity descriptions for **Expos**-facing workshops


### EXTRA FEATURE REQUESTS

* public web-view of these (and selections from them)
* slack integration for creating simple link-based resources
* launch help@learninglab.xyz again
