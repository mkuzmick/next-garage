# resource-scripting-basics

ideas for the initial scripts

* navigating in terminal
* what is the `$PATH`?
* creating a simple script and launching it
* some key commands
    * `echo`
    * `ls`
    * `pbcopy`
    * `open`
    * `say`
    * `cat`
    * `cd`
    * `pwd`
    * `mkdir`
    * `cp`
    * `mv`
    * `|`
    * `>` and `>>`
    * `touch`
    * `chmod`
    * `rm`
    * `aws`?
    * `heroku`?
    * `ffmpeg`?
    * `ffprobe`?
    * `gif`?
    * `youtube-dl`?
        * this could be the first command learned, and then
        * this could motivate the first script (just to avoid having to memorize all the flags)
* the `.zshrc` file
    * and functions in there
    * and defining the prompt
    * and defining environment variables
*
