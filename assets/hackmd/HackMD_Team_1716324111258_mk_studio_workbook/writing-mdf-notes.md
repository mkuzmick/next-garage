# writing-mdf-notes


- motivations
            - un- or at least underpaid grad students
            - unemployable grad students
            - little impact in the wider world
            - within the ed-media space, a division between thinkers and makers
            - the phone/human hybrid thing
            - the danger of platforms
            - do you *know* something? or have you memorized a set of terms and behaviors?
            - the cool thing is that we get to have 100 iterations a term (at least!) of something faculty and grads get to do once per project (the graphical abstract, the video interview, the podcast, etc)


0. puzzles
    * job market = tough
    * the literacies that matter in the external world are shifting (too quickly for the U to keep up)
    * there is also lots of work that seems to go beyond what a typical TF can do in a course
    * how do you do new things? you can't start until you're asked, but you can't know how to do them until you start?
    * phone/human hybrid thing
    * 
1. history (it has taken a while). funding, empire and nomads. high-level goals.
    * perform work for faculty and their courses
        * including direct instruction for undergrads
    * develop graduate student skills (both to make them better teachers and better at whatever they choose to do next)
2. what they do. specifics of the role (Katie)
    * paid hourly
    * 10 hours/week for up to 150 hours each term (which ends up being about a fifth if they work all the hours)
    * we contact departments and give preference to any nominees they suggest
    * but we also allow students to apply directly
        * if from a dept we ask that dept if they'd like them to be the departmental MDF
        * if not, we consider whether to hire them as a Bok MDF
    * [link to job description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1afv_okcKTzRjPnQzHFOrPDD96ou6ApbFR_zY1bHc2vU/edit)
    * [link to Bok website description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1afv_okcKTzRjPnQzHFOrPDD96ou6ApbFR_zY1bHc2vU/edit)
    * we also employ MDFs for smaller chunks of time (50-hour projects, for instance) throughout the year, as this frequently matches faculty and grad needs more than a full-year position.

            - non-GSAS fellows' special skills
    - past fellows
    - media production assistants part of mdfs
    - return fellows for flexible $$
3. the day to day and week to week
    * meetings
        * weekly, but alternating, full team meetings
        * weekly "lab" meetings
            * learning & researching
            * designing & building
            * testing & practicing
        * consulting with Bok Staff
            (Grace?)
        * leading workshops
            (Grace & Jessi?)
        * making things
            * written resources
            * websites
            * media content
4. the big picture
    * projects (up from 1 per term)
    
5. accidents and discoveries
    * a mix of something you've planned an something that emerges (the Jessi activity)
    
    
* where does new stuff come from?
    * if you already know something it's not new; if you don't know it, you can't find it.
    * does new stuff emerge like sleep---you aren't aiming directly at it. It just happens when you prepare the conditions?
    * or practices?

        - how can you get to new things
            - is it like sleep? you have to get out of the way and let it happen?
            - does it happen through a quantitative intensification of what alread exists? (which leads to a kind of qualitative leap?)
            - does it happen through strange conjunctions (and those, if not yet familiar with the content and result of this particular conjunction, are expert at the choreographies of relating, relationships, partnerships and duality that underlie any such conjunction)
