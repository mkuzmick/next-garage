# writing-on-databasing-to-learn-and-more


## ON DATABASING TO LEARN AND MORE

sorry---last thing! But here's something that's emerging in many of our "databasing-to-learn" design sessions with MDFs and faculty this year:
faculty get excited by the database or collection or gallery as a powerful system of datapoints . . . its magnitude and complexity match their sense of what academic work involves: the system of ideas in a paper, the system of objects/events/data and theoretical models that makes up their discipline as a whole, etc.
so there's this intuition that if there is such a powerful analogy (or more than analogy!) between the online gallery and what it means to have expertise in a discipline, then this MUST be an ideal assignment, with perfect alignment between the activity and the learning objectives
BUT they also know that they can't ask each student to do the whole thing, so they give each student the task of populating a pre-existing system/database/grid/form/spreadsheet with entries and examples, a few bite-sized contributions that can actually be accomplished.
so here's the PROBLEM: the actual higher-order thinking happens in the design of the system, and in many of these assignments this higher order thinking is left to a relatively opinionated platform like timeline.js or relatively unopinionated framework like scalar.  Students are left with the lower-order task of data-entry, which rarely gets at whether they've grasped the larger conceptual frameworks of the course (at best they can "tag" these frameworks as keyterms so that posts can be sorted according to them

* the essay too has 5-10 examples, and perhaps devotes 100-200 words to each, but it places each in a framework, and the total words surrounding each example contribute to its significance
* gap between ed tech approach and multimodal essay approach
* writing as a tool for thinking, knowing, learning; the most complex thing you can build, the most in alignment with what it means to know
* and if you assign the gallery without the synthetic storytelling move, it's problematic
* kant, piaget . . . determinate vs reflective judgment

where it's ok to define schemas . . . where it's a blank canvas and the guidance helps. Has to be where the "difficult" thing exists in one of the cells.
* spotifies song schema doesn't hurt Billie Eilish's ability to create. Maybe this is where the schema comes in "after the fact" or something like that? Or the schema is really one for the act of creation you care about (rather than a part of a larger creative whole)? 

* also maybe nested part-wholes?
	* system, schema, element at course level
	* assignment level
	* individual contribution level
	* parts within parts
* then circle the places where "the action" is . . . won't always be the same.
* walk through some different forms
	* podcasts
	* video essays
	* web essays
	* presentations
	* papers
	* galleries and curations
	* timelines
* start with making stuff meaningful, piaget and schemas, pivoting to tech as a surprising analog? rather than starting with tech?
* equipment for living
* grammar of moves, etc
	* parts and wholes
	* schemas
	* levels and layers

* on the film vs _____
	* something on the "most viewed films of all time"
	* more films created each hour than in the entire history of cinema _ to _
